Engaging with paper documents thus requires familiarity with concepts such as a table of contents, chapters, running headers, page numbers, citations, reference lists, appendices, and how they are used as parts of a system. Beyond those pertaining specifically to the paper page are concepts derived from the environments in which people engage and work with paper documents. Examples are the clipboard, paper bin, folders, files, and activities such as cutting, pasting, and paging — transferred into the digital realm as metaphors. These are some of the conventions inherited from paper documents.</p><p>An example of an inherited bias is how computer operating systems are based on a hierarchical taxonomic structure inherited from the paper document management system, called <em>the file system</em>. In accordance with the file system, a computer file must be named and can only be placed in one folder, which must also be named. If a file should be placed in multiple folders (because it belongs to multiple categories), that file must be <em>copied</em> into other folders.<sup id="fnref:macOS" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:macOS" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> In other words, the constraints of that system are also inherited.</p><p>Digital computers can be embedded with any conceivable construct, so if, for example, a file system based on a hierarchical taxonomic structure is not convenient, then such a system can and should be re-imagined.</p><h2 id="what-is-meant-by-digital-document">What is meant by <em>digital document</em>?</h2><p>A digital document primarily contains the modality text, and the medium used for its transmission is digital computers.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-distinct-properties-of-a-digital-document-versus-a-paper-document">What are the distinct properties of a digital document versus a paper document?</h2><p>Whereas a paper document primarily contains text but can also contain images and other graphic elements, a digital document can additionally contain video, sound, and other interactive elements.</p><p>Operating under the premise (which is substantiated below) that the medium used for the transmission of text yields particular constraints and capacities, two distinct properties are relevant to the juxtaposition of paper documents and digital documents:</p><ol><li>Text on the paper page is inscribed and static; text in the digital realm is encoded and dynamic (Weel 2012).</li><li>With text on the paper page, actions are direct; with text in the digital realm, actions are interactive.</li></ol><h3 id="1-text-on-the-paper-page-is-inscribed-and-static-text-in-the-digital-realm-is-encoded-and-dynamic">1. Text on the paper page is inscribed and static; text in the digital realm is encoded and dynamic</h3><p>With text on the paper page, language takes a static material form. From a historical perspective, the materialization of language significantly impacted human cognition. In <em>The Mind on Paper: Reading, Consciousness and Rationality</em>, developmental psychologist David Olson (2017) gives an analysis incorporating a historical account of the relationship between literacy and forms of thought and by his account, engaging and working with paper documents engendered critical thinking and systematic knowledge (Olson 2017). Similar claims are made by Eric Havelock (1976), who in <em>Origins of Western Literacy</em> establishes an integral relationship between the technology of writing and rational and analytic thought. And on the study of reading and its impact on cognition, as Neil Postman (1986) points out, it has been concluded by most scholars “that the sequential, propositional character of the written word fosters what Walter Ong calls the ‘analytic management of knowledge.’”</p><p>It is not suggested that analytic thought and rationality were not possible prior to written language, but to engage with text is “to follow a line of thought, which requires considerable powers of classifying, inference-making and reasoning.” It requires mapping ideas, comparing assertions, “connect[ing] one generalization to another” (Postman 1986). By example from research within the learning sciences, Roy Pea (1985) discusses the form of arguments, contrasting oral and written language, and its impact on logical analysis. With text on the paper page, human memory capacities were extended, allowing an argument to be stored and directly available to the reader/writer to evaluate the relationship between its parts for consistency and locate potential contradictions. With the advent of print technology, in particular, there was a greater capacity for “precision in the transmission of detail,” leading to a “much greater exactness in the representation of knowledge […] through the use of such typically typographic aids as tables and different typefaces, font sizes, and white space as a means of ordering information” (Weel 2012).</p><blockquote><p>Uniformity, predictability, consistency, and standardization were prerequisites for analytical and scientific thinking. (Weel 2012)</p></blockquote><p>These effects on human cognition are related to the staticity of (and what it entails to engage with) text on the paper page.<sup id="fnref:primarily_text" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:primarily_text" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> In contrast, digital text is marked by dynamicity and modifiability. At a basic level, digital text is encoded as a bit pattern (e.g., 1010111) representing a character unit (e.g., W). As Stéfan Sinclair and Geoffrey Rockwell (2016) suggest, these properties of digital text imply an infinite potential for rearrangement and restructuring through algorithmic play (i.e., move these bits here to there, extract only those bits, rearrange them according to this, then that, and put those here). At yet another level, digital text is encoded through a markup language. Encoding text involves “marking up” the structure, the visual presentation, and the metadata—all of which can be utilized in working with and modifying (the form, content, and meaning of) texts. Importantly, modification of digital text by modifying the code that transcribes the text can be done without repercussions to source content. That is, the process of rearranging parts, transforming between formats, extracting and sorting text segments, annotating or performing analyses on those extracted text segments involves operations that can be performed without repercussions to the source content. With paper documents, such actions are enacted directly upon the material, so additional information (e.g., annotations, symbols, citations, footnotes, and so on) is, by convention, congested on the same page.</p><h3 id="2-with-text-on-the-paper-page-actions-are-direct-with-text-in-the-digital-realm-actions-are-interactive">2. With text on the paper page, actions are direct; with text in the digital realm, actions are interactive.</h3><p>Any action is direct when engaging and working with text on the paper page. That is, actions such as writing, underlining, erasing, cutting out, pasting in, folding, stacking, sorting, and resorting, are in a direct relationship between the action, the operations involved in that action, and the perception of that action. In the digital realm, a command — a keystroke, a tap on a touchscreen, a verbal utterance — can equate near-infinite set of (opaque) operations. Given these distinctive properties, text in the digital realm invites modification of its parts in ways that are infeasible with text on the paper page. This project aims to explore the potential of these properties based on accommodating the interconnection of documents.</p><h2 id="what-does-it-mean-to-map-and-access-multiple-text-structures">What does it mean to <em>map</em> and <em>access</em> multiple text structures?</h2><p><em>To map</em> is the activity of creating connections either by attaching metadata to documents or links between documents’ content items. Mapping text structure can be done by both the reader and writer of documents. <em>To access</em> is used to encompass <em>retrieving</em>, <em>bringing into view</em>, <em>filtering</em>, <em>arranging</em>, and <em>traversing</em> documents based on those connections in a coherent manner. The connections (in the form of interactive visual links) enable access based on documents or links belonging to the same category, or the kind that enables access based on a link path — pointing from one particular content item to another.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-docuverse">What is the <em>docuverse</em>?</h2><p>The docuverse — as in <em>universe of documents</em> — is a term coined by Ted Nelson that describes a universal library system on networked computers. As Nelson writes in <em>Literary Machines</em>:</p><blockquote><p>All of storage near and far must therefore become a united whole— what is now called a “distributed database.” […] The documents and their links unite into what is essentially a swirling complex of equi-accessible unity, a single great universal text and data grid, or, as we call it, the docuverse (Nelson 1987).</p></blockquote><p>In other words, the docuverse is a construct in which documents live, understood as a metadocument with all the information about documents’ contents and linkages, including their version history. The concepts and implementations of Nelson’s vision of the docuverse (among other historical examples of systems based on accommodating interconnection) are examined in the <a href="3">next entry</a>.</p><h2 id="what-is-interconnection">What is <em>interconnection</em>?</h2><p>See next entry, <a href="3">On Interconnection and the Boundary of Documents</a>.</p><h2 id="sources">Sources</h2><p>Havelock EA.

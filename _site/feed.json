Selecting another node will close the already-open document and open the other. Similar to how selecting a bookmarked URL in a browser opens a website, it replaces the displayed website if another bookmarked URL is selected. It is, of course, possible to open a new tab, but the difference here is that the documents can be opened on the same plane, and the connections are visualized as links across the boundary of documents (similar to what Ted Nelson calls Transpointing Windows in his Xanadu system).Version 1In the image above, the linked documents are always visible and join in the middle of the open document.Version 2The image below shows an alternate version in which the linked documents are only visible when hovering on a link in the open document (called Vertical View).In both versions, if a link is selected within an open document, the corresponding document is opened, and the linked content items align (in Lateral Mode).Open/Close MechanismWhile in Lateral Mode, if another link within one of the two open documents is selected, the other document closes, and the corresponding document opens. This open/close mechanism allows traveling by links while retaining one document as the main document. The main document is always the document from which a link is selected. In the image below, the open/close mechanism is shown.Note that only the first-level linked nodes of an open document are visible in Lateral Mode. As indicated in the last step in the image above, closing a document will hide its linked nodes unless linked to one of the open documents.Lateral Mode (as in the lateral reading strategy) enables checking the original context of a transcluded content item through deliberate action. Through the use of tag links, it is also possible to sort which link types should be displayed. This means it is possible to travel by a link path according to a selected tag (e.g., #comment, #elaboration, #definition).Video DemonstrationThe video below demonstrates switching from Inventory View to Vertical Mode and Lateral Mode.Failed AttemptsAttempts at Visualizing Opening a Document in Inventory ViewIn the video below, the links are visualized as vertical lines on each side of the document. The thickness of the lines corresponds with the number of linked content items. One of the drawbacks here is that there is too much information visualized simultaneously.The video below demonstrates a slow transition from Inventory View to Vertical Mode. The question here is, what is the best way to animate a link within an open document to a closed document (node). In this example, hovering on a link has the effect of extending the line to the content item within the open document, and the closed document (node) scales up. A drawback is that the scaling effect does not immediately capture attention.Attempts at Visualizing Opening a Document in Vertical ModeOnce in Vertical Mode, the selected link opens the corresponding document. The question here is, how should the linked content objects interact. In this example, upon opening a document by selecting a link, the linked content objects align, and the links fade out.

Stack ViewA stack is made up of a set of documents represented as layers that contain content objects.StackA stack can be thought of as a workspace.

In the image below there are four layers: #MAIN, #A, #B, and #C.Content ObjectContent objects are the parts that make up a text, of which there are many types: paragraphs, lists, emphatic phrases, titles, quotes, comments and so on. A content object can have any number of tags, placing it in multiple layers.Link TypesIn the image below there are several links between the layers. As defined in the previous entry, there are two general types of connections that cross the boundaries of documents: those that are transclusions (identical extracts in separate documents), and those that are not.

            "summary": null,
            "content_text": "✱ It’s a draft.A document is a container of content objects, which can vary in modality (text, images). Taken from the text What is Text, Really? by Steven DeRose (1990), content objects are what Charles van den Heuvel and W. Boyd Rayward (2011) calls “information chunks” and what Ted Nelson (1999) calls “content items.” In traditional terms, a paragraph is a content object; a quote within a paragraph is also a content object; a list and a list item are content objects. In other words, content objects vary not only in modality but are distinguished by type.The concept of interconnection, on which this project is based, denotes the various connections among the content objects of documents. As Nelson (1987) explains, connections can be internal or external to a document, stated implicitly or explicitly. For example, phrases such as “in the example given below,” “demonstrated in the image above,” or “stated previously” establish implicit internal connections. Explicit internal connections are content objects that by convention take the form of a footnote or marginal annotations, the content of which can be an elaboration of a term used, an example of something, or a tangent or comment on something. Explicit external connections are inclusions of one document segment into another (what Nelson (1980) coined transclusions) or some other direct connection by way of reference.There are various terms used to express the idea of interconnection. As Christine Borgman (2015) writes, “[t]he body of relationships among documents is sometimes known as hypertextuality, and in semiotics and literary studies, it is called intertextuality, which is abstract connections, “as in the influence of one text on the meaning of another.” Nelson (2015) calls it intertwingularity which “expresses a philosophical position about cross-connection,” namely that “all subjects and issues are intertwined and intermingled.” Lastly, by example, a data model based on interconnection is one that allows a many-to-many relationship among entities. Entities with many many-to-many relationships form clusters, and clusters can also form many-to-many relationships to other clusters. Further, the connections can be based on (or describe, or establish, or map) various relationship types.Thus, interconnection here means connected on multiple levels and is used to describe the various relationships among the contents of documents, some of which go beyond the boundary of documents. Mapping these connections creates complex multidimensional structures, and how exactly these are mapped and visualized is shaped by the medium of the document. In what follows, analog and digital systems designed for mapping, visualizing, and accessing content based on interconnection are examined.Analog and Digital Systems Based on InterconnectionAn early analog system developed for mapping and visualizing interconnection is the “compilation of Jewish Oral Law with its rabbinical commentaries” organized according to the Talmud page. Representing centuries of religious discussion, the Talmud:  consists of the core texts, commentaries by various authors […] navigational aids (such as page number, tractate name, chapter number, chapter name) and glosses. Most of these glosses are emendations to the text, while others contain useful (or cryptic) cross-references. (Neumüller transcluded from Ridi (2018))The image below demonstrates how the Talmud Page is organized.A Guide to the Layout of a Talmud Page by Joshua ParkerOther analog systems include the Encyclopédie by Denis Diderot and Jean d’Alembert; Paul Otlet’s principles, methods, and model of a global network of documentation; the hypothetical machine the Memex by Vannevar Bush; and Niklas Luhmann’s notecard system based on the Zettelkasten Method. The most prominent example of a digital system is the original hypertext project Xanadu by Ted Nelson. These all share the conceptualization of documents as nodes that are linked through some mechanism and according to a system. In other words, these are examples of multidimensional structures. In consideration of the scope of this entry, three of the examples given above are examined in more depth:  Encyclopédie by Denis Diderot and Jean d’Alembert  The work of Paul Otlet  Xanadu by Ted NelsonEncyclopédie is a system of intraconnections (i.e., a closed system of internal references; an intranet). Otlet’s principles, concepts, and models are based on interconnections and emergent structure (i.e., open system of references). Xanadu by Nelson is also a system of interconnections and emergent structure, but with consideration of the potential of the computer as a universal machine.1 Encyclopédie by Diderot and d’AlembertVarious information technologies for mapping interconnection (non-)hierarchically were produced in the eighteenth century, ranging from atlases, encyclopedias, dictionaries, and suchlike. A prominent example is the Encyclopédie by Diderot and d’Alembert, which as Rosenberg (2015) argues, was an innovative system for its time. In its entirety, the Encyclopédie is a system of intraconnections — which is to say, a closed system of cross-references — comprising 28 volumes of 72000 entries by more than 2000 writers. Though the design incorporates ways for external reference, the Encyclopédie was conceived and meant to be used as an independent system.The alphabetical structure is embedded as running headers throughout the encyclopedia (as seen in the image below), allowing access to content by headword.Transcluded from Internet ArchiveOther examples include annotated diagrams depicting the contents and functioning as a visual index. A tree diagram from the first volume is seen in the image below.Transcluded from Internet ArchiveThe textual and diagrammatic ways of mapping structures are hierarchical, as was the convention at the time. However, as Rosenberg explains:  Older encyclopedias were generally organized hierarchically and by subject. Theirs was designed to be navigated by keyword, to allow readers to enter and exit at any useful point. Additionally, their encyclopedia was hypertexted. Articles were linked in a web through a system of renvois or cross-references. The Encyclopédie also offered a hierarchical subject map, echoing the structure of older works, but, in the work of Diderot and d’Alembert, the tree of knowledge was presented as only one of several heuristics. (Rosenberg 2015)Additionally, as the computer-generated diagram (seen in the image below) elucidate, an underlying structure “implicit in the system of cross-references of the Encyclopédie” (Rosenberg 2015) is a network structure in which there are many-to-many relationships among subjects.Diagram by Olsen and Blanchard (transcluded from Rosenberg (2015))There are two significant points the diagram elucidates. First, conceiving knowledge as fundamentally hierarchical is not “paradigmatic of Enlightenment epistemology.” Second, nor is it intrinsic to print. As Rosenberg argues, though the  network diagram would not have been familiar to the generation of the Encyclopedists, the concepts behind it were. They too were thinking about intellectual phenomena in terms of underlying structures and aggregate relationships. (Rosenberg 2015)In sum, significant to the design of the Encyclopédie:  A system of intraconnections.  Typographic embedded links.  Multiple (non)hierarchical structures are mapped, both textual and diagrammatic in form, offering multiple ways of accessing content.2 The Work of Paul OtletThe work of Paul Otlet — regarded as a pioneer of the field once called documentation that branched into what is now called information science (Le Deuff and Perret 2019) — range from devising the model called Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records in which entities are linked on multiple levels in the form of a network (Borgman 2015) to developing new approaches to organizing and accessing information by establishing theoretical principles of information. Otlet also explored how information organization might be in the future in the form of illustrations serving as metaphors of a global network of documents once media other than the book would take precedence (Heuvel and Rayward 2011).Similar to the Encyclopédie — a project regarded as in response to the eighteenth-century information overload (Rosenberg 2015) — Otlet’s work was in response to the problem of “the enormous growth in the number of publications, specialist congresses, and international exhibitions that began to occur at the end of the nineteenth century” (Manfroid 2013).As Rayward (1994) formulates it, the problem that Otlet analyzed and explored solutions to was “how most effectively to create, maintain, and change institutional arrangements for collecting, storing, preserving, organizing, retrieving, and disseminating all of the recorded information that is-or will be-needed within society.” With that complex problem at hand, Otlet envisioned new approaches to storing, organizing, and disseminating information while accommodating expansive growth and extensive reuse. Some of the most significant aspects of his work are delineated below.  Conceptualization of text as modular.  Re-conceptualizing the Book as:          A global system of linked content objects:              Based on interconnection and emergent structure,      And the necessity of multidimensional linking of content objects.      Otlet conceptualized text as modular — made up of parts connected to other parts (internal and external to a document). An appropriate system, according to Otlet, must therefore allow and facilitate establishing links between these parts (content objects). In designing such a system, Otlet explored the re-conceptualization of the Book as a global system of documents. As told by Heuvel and Rayward:  In a 1911 lecture on the future of the book and of bibliography, Otlet came back to the idea he had first expressed in 1892 and in subsequent publications: ‘The arbitrary division into lines and pages of the book in its present format, does not at all correspond all with the presentation of ideas’ (p. 291). He envisioned the emergence of a future format of the book in which ‘each intellectual element, in corresponding to a physical element, will create a structure such that any combination of ideas, notions, and facts will be possible.’ He suggested that this process can operate in so mechanical a fashion that in the future, the book will truly become a machine to think with (Otlet transcluded from Heuvel and Rayward (2011))As the two illustrations below suggests, for Otlet, the development of such a system entails ripping content objects (representing ideas, notions, facts) from books and collecting each on separate paper cards.Global Network of Universal Documentation (transcluded from Heuvel and Rayward (2011))Title and SourceThe system must, therefore, also be designed to accommodate expansive growth and extensive reuse. For Otlet, this meant the capacity to both store and accsess content objects by links and metadata. In the image below, Otlet explored a paper card-based system to establish multidimensional links between content objects.Multidimensional card system  (transcluded from Heuvel and Rayward (2011))As Otlet writes:  To increase the number of sides, one might well abandon the rectangular form of the card and adopt a polygonal form, an octagon for example. For sorting and systematically selecting the ideas that have been classified hierarchically, the cards are suspended from their centre. The Book as a structure of cards thus takes a quasi-circular form and can rotate. [I]ts structure […] constitutes a Book—for it is still a book—that has abandoned the traditional form of linear text arranged according to a unique plan. It has been transformed in some way into a body with several dimensions, as many dimensions as headings such that different searches using the same graphic elements on the cards are possible. (Otlet transcluded from Heuvel and Rayward (2011))As Heuvel and Rayward (2011) point out, though the material manifestation of such a paper card system is “impractical for many reasons,” what Otlet is describing is an open system for mapping and accessing content, based on the interconnection of subjects. Beyond these experiments with paper cards, Otlet envisioned new approaches to accessing content and new visual representations. For example, in the image below, “Otlet uses the architectural metaphor of the factory to visualize this process” (Heuvel 2017).Laboratorium Mundaneum (transcluded from Wikimedia Commons)Though Otlet was inhibited by the constraints of working with paper-based technologies (e.g., books, paper cards, shelves, cabinets, and desks), he envisioned new ways of organizing and accessing information beyond what Weel (2012) calls the “order of the book”.In sum, significant to the work of Otlet:  Conceptualization of text as modular; made up of content objects.  Developed a system based on interconnections; networked information organization based on emergent structure and new ways of linking those content objects.  Explored ways of storing and accessing content objects through experiments with cards and metaphorical visualizations.3 Xanadu by Ted NelsonReferencesBorgman CL. Data, Metadata, and Ted.

            "content_html": "<p>✱ It’s a draft.</p><p>A document is a container of content objects, which can vary in modality (text, images). Taken from the text <em>What is Text, Really?</em> by Steven DeRose (1990), content objects are what Charles van den Heuvel and W. Boyd Rayward (2011) calls “information chunks” and what Ted Nelson (1999) calls “content items.” In traditional terms, a paragraph is a content object; a quote within a paragraph is also a content object; a list and a list item are content objects. In other words, content objects vary not only in modality but are distinguished by type.</p><p>The concept of interconnection, on which this project is based, denotes the various connections among the content objects of documents. As Nelson (1987) explains, connections can be internal or external to a document, stated implicitly or explicitly. For example, phrases such as “in the example given below,” “demonstrated in the image above,” or “stated previously” establish implicit internal connections. Explicit internal connections are content objects that by convention take the form of a footnote or marginal annotations, the content of which can be an elaboration of a term used, an example of something, or a tangent or comment on something. Explicit external connections are inclusions of one document segment into another (what Nelson (1980) coined transclusions) or some other direct connection by way of reference.</p><p>There are various terms used to express the idea of interconnection. As Christine Borgman (2015) writes, “[t]he body of relationships among documents is sometimes known as <em>hypertextuality</em>, and in semiotics and literary studies, it is called <em>intertextuality</em>, which is abstract connections, “as in the influence of one text on the meaning of another.” Nelson (2015) calls it <em>intertwingularity</em> which “expresses a philosophical position about cross-connection,” namely that “all subjects and issues are intertwined and intermingled.” Lastly, by example, a data model based on interconnection is one that allows a many-to-many relationship among entities. Entities with many many-to-many relationships form clusters, and clusters can also form many-to-many relationships to other clusters. Further, the connections can be based on (or describe, or establish, or map) various relationship types.</p><p>Thus, interconnection here means <em>connected on multiple levels</em> and is used to describe the various relationships among the contents of documents, some of which go beyond the boundary of documents. Mapping these connections creates complex multidimensional structures, and how exactly these are mapped and visualized is shaped by the medium of the document. In what follows, analog and digital systems designed for mapping, visualizing, and accessing content based on interconnection are examined.</p><h3 id=\"analog-and-digital-systems-based-on-interconnection\">Analog and Digital Systems Based on Interconnection</h3><p>An early analog system developed for mapping and visualizing interconnection is the “compilation of Jewish Oral Law with its rabbinical commentaries” organized according to the Talmud page.

The contents of a document under the category paper text is primarily text and the medium used for its transmission is paper, which means it includes both manuscript and print. Though the contents of a paper text is primarily encoded language in graphic form, it variably contains graphics such as charts, maps, illustrations, and so on. In terms of engaging with paper text, it follows that:  Text interpretation involves processes of reading texts, graphics, tables, etc.—be they external sources or one’s own text—and constructing mental representations from it. [And writing] includes activities such as creating visual-spatial representations, pictures, and graphs. (Zahn 2017)Furthermore, engaging with paper text requires familiarity with conventions developed for communicating about text structure.What are those conventions?At the most basic level, an example of a convention developed for reading and writing text is:  the use of spaces between words. Classical Greek and Roman texts were written in what is called ‘continuous script’, without spaces […] Gradually, an increasing number of design and layout aids were introduced: […] capital letters at the beginning of sentences, line breaks, and a variety of punctuation marks such as commas, semicolons, colons and periods. Also, concepts such as paragraphs and chapters developed into a standardized system that allowed the structure intended by the authors to be transmitted to readers familiar with these standards. (Bruijn 2015)Conventions particular to paper text are those derived from what Weel calls Order of the Book — that is, presentation and structure of text based on the form of books and defined by the format of manuscript and print (Weel 2012). Engaging with paper text thus require a familiarity with concepts such as a table of contents, chapters, running headers, page numbers, and the interplay between them. Some such conventions were inherited by digital text.So what is meant by digital text?A digital text primarily contains the modality text and the medium used for its transmission is digital computers. Operating under the premise that the medium used for the transmission of text yield particular constraints and capacities, relevant to the juxtaposition of digital text and paper text are the following distinguishing properties:1. Paper text is inscribed and static; digital text is encoded and dynamic.With text on the paper page, language takes a static material form. From a historical perspective, the materialization of language had a great impact on human cognition. In The Mind on Paper: Reading, Consciousness and Rationality, developmental psychologist David Olson (2017) gives an analysis incorporating a historical account of the relationship between literacy and forms of thought. By his account, engaging with paper text engendered critical thinking and systematic knowledge (Olson 2017). Similar claims are made by Eric Havelock (1976), who in Origins of Western Literacy establishes an integral relationship between the technology of writing and rational and analytic thought. By example from research within the learning sciences, Roy Pea (1985) discusses the form of arguments contrasting oral and written language and its impact on logical analysis. With text on the paper page, human memory capacity was extended, allowing an argument to be stored and directly available to the reader/writer to evaluate the relationship between its parts (e.g. premises, (sub)claims, main claim) for consistency and locate potential contradictions. With the advent of print technology in particular, there was a greater capacity for “precision in the transmission of detail” leading to a “much greater exactness in the representation of knowledge […] through the use of such typically typographic aids as tables and different typefaces, font sizes, and white space as a means of ordering information” (Weel 2012).  Uniformity, predictability, consistency, and standardisation were prerequisites for analytical and scientific thinking. (Weel 2012)These effects on human cognition are related to the staticity of (and what it entails to engage with) paper text. In contrast, digital text is marked by dynamicity and modifiability. At a basic level digital text is encoded as a bit pattern (e.g. 1010111) representing a character unit (e.g. W). As Stéfan Sinclair and Geoffrey Rockwell (2016) suggest, these properties of digital text imply an infinite potential for rearrangement and restructuring through algorithmic play (i.e. move these bits here to there, extract only those bits, rearrange them according to this, then that, and put those here). At yet another level, digital text is encoded by means of a markup language, which entails “marking up” the structure of a text, the visual presentation and the metadata—all of which can be utilized in tinkering with (the form, content, and meaning of) digital text. Importantly, modification of digital text by tinkering with the code that transcribes the text can be done without repercussions to source content. That is, in the process of rearranging parts, transforming between formats, extracting and sorting text segments, annotating or performing analyses on those extracted text segments, and so on — these operations can be performed without repercussions to the source content. With paper text, such actions are enacted directly upon on the material, and so additional information (e.g. annotations, symbols, citations, footnotes, and so on) is conventionally congested on the same page, which leads to the second distinguishing properties:2. With paper text an action is direct; with digital text actions are interactive.When engaging with paper text any action is direct. That is, actions such as writing, underlining, erasing, cutting out, pasting in, folding, sorting and resorting, are in a direct relationship between the action, the operations involved in that action, and the perception of that action. In the digital realm, a command — which can be a key stroke, a tap on a touchscreen, a verbal utterance, and so on — can equate a near infinite set of (opaque) operations.Given these distinguishing properties, digital text invites tinkering with its parts in ways that are infeasible with text on the paper page. Exploring the potential of these properties of digital text, based on the premise that all texts are interconnected, is the aim of this project.ReferencesBruijn M de.

Title[1]Tinkering with Textual Structures: A Digital Construct[2]A Digital Construct for Tinkering With Text Structure[3]A Construct for Tinkering With Digital Text2. QuestionWhat may result from undermining the biases and conventions inherited from paper text when creating a construct for digital text, based on the premise that all texts are interconnected?3. HypothesisThe implication of interconnection is that every text has multiple potential structures, which a construct in the digital realm can be created to reflect. To that end, the construct must support activities for mapping, visualizing, and accessing different structures.[1]Paper text has always been confined by the media object used, be it a book, folder, pamphlet, or journal. Thus, c [2]Text has always been confined by the material properties of the medium used for its transmission, whether that be inscribed tablets of gold or clay, or be it handwritten or printed ink on paper. Bound by the material properties of books and other paper documents, conventions developed for mapping and visualizing interconnection in the ages of manuscript and print thus entailed embedding categories of information in the form of such concepts as footnotes and marginal annotations. Some such conventions have been transferred to the digital realm. Instead of embedding connections, a construct in the digital realm can represent such connections in ways that are not feasible with paper text. With that as a point of departure, this project entails creating a construct for digital text with the aim to re-imagine how interconnection can be represented. Mapping and visualizing interconnection within and between texts can result in complex layers of information. These complex layers of information are conceptualized and visually implemented as components in a three-dimensional space that can be made visible or hidden through deliberate action. In the three-dimensional space, it is possible to access both the hierarchical and non-hierarchical structures of the main text that have been mapped. By accessing the hierarchical structure—comprising content objects such as a title, subtitles, and paragraphs, without any other types of content objects visible—people can conventionally obtain the main points (e.g., introduction, main body, and conclusion). People may tinker with that structure by making other content objects visible. In effect, people switch between perspectives on the main text, which shapes their understanding. In re-imagining how interconnection can be mapped, visualized, and accessed within and across texts, the final version of the construct enables a tinkering approach to engaging with text.4. MethodThe purpose of the construct is to aid [1]thinking [2]working with text by supporting activities for mapping, visualizing, and accessing different structures. Within the bounds of feasibility, this project entails writing a text on the topic of interconnection, which is mapped and visualized in the construct. The end result will allow people to access what has been mapped. The following is a tentative outline of the process.Step 1: Conceptualize the constructThis is the blueprint step. It entails creating sketches of the components that make up the construct, including explanations of how those components interact. For example, sets of linked content objects (e.g. a paragraph, a phrase within a paragraph, a subtitle, a list item, a note on a list, etc.) can be grouped to form a single entity. Each entity — that is, a set of content objects — can be linked to other entities. The visualization and functionality of these components are tested in step 3.Step 2: Write the main text that is to be implemented in the constructThe main text introduces and defines the term interconnection, explaining the philosophical position it holds and providing historical examples of media shaped to represent how subjects are connected on multiple levels. Through these examples, the biases and conventions inherited from paper text are examined, including a discussion on the (dis)advantages. Tied in to that discussion is the potential for re-imagining how interconnection can be represented in the digital realm. In this sense, it results in a self-reflexive project. Throughout the process of writing the main text, small problems are expected to emerge. In response to these problems, interactive visual tests serving as potential solutions are created in the following step.Step 3: Create interactive visual tests of the constructOne such problem to solve could be how the interaction works, for example, how to switch from one perspective to another in such a way that the interaction supports an understanding that each perspective represents an alternate structure of the same text (albeit, different versions). Another hypothetical problem could be how different categories of information are distinguished. If, for example, footnotes as traditionally implemented in paper text are abandoned, then how are these categories of information dealt with in the construct? And even further, how are different types of footnotes distinguished (e.g. a reference from a tangent, from an example, from a definition of a term)? The interactive visual tests created in this step are expected to lead to modifications of the construct on a conceptual level. As each informs the other, steps 2-3 are iterated until it is surmised that enough has been gathered for step 4.Step 4: Full implementation of the constructThis step involves completing the main text and the design of the construct by making improvements based on what has been gathered in the previous steps.5. DocumentationFor each iteration of steps 2-3, the resulting interactive visual tests are documented and published on this weblog. Each entry contains the current version of the main text and the construct (i.e. the interactive visual tests described in step 3). A written reflection is included, serving to inform modifications for improvement. The final version of the construct (which includes the final version of the main text) is to be developed in [1]Unity [2]a prototyping software and published online. To that end, there are two workflows. The workflow for publishing the construct entails (1) exporting the project from [1]Unity [2]the prototyping software, which is (2) uploaded on Github for continuous deployment, then (3) pinned on IPFS via Fleek, and (4) accessed via a website URL. Hence the process of creating the construct is documented and publicly accessible. The workflow for writing the texts is designed so that a single editorial file can be converted to various formats. Thus, the texts intended for the weblog entries and the main text intended for the construct are all written in an extended version of the Markdown format, which can be exported into various output formats (e.g. HTML, TXT, XML) using digital tools.6. EvaluationBoth the documentation of the process and the final version of the construct inform the evaluation. The documentation of the process comprises written reflections of significant steps, and the final version of the construct serves as a demonstration of how digital representation of interconnection can be re-imagined. In order for the construct to hold the main argument, the following points must be reflected:  Does the construct enable tinkering with the hierarchical presentation of the main text?  Does accessing those different structures reflect switching between perspectives on the main text?  [1]Are there potential advantages to how switching between perspectives is implemented?The evaluation thus contends whether or not the construct demonstrates the above points. Functioning as a preliminary list, additions and modifications are expected throughout the process.",

            "content_text": "The following summarizes and reflects on the process and result of this research project.Summary of the BackgroundDocuments are containers of content items (representing ideas, theories, facts, beliefs, and so on). By creating different types of connections among content items, an interconnective structure can be formed. Types of connections can be implicit or explicit and external or internal.Model of different types of connectionsCurrently-available software does not offer ways for mapping the interconnective structure of documents, nor is it visualized. Instead, it remains an underlying structure. For example, computer documents are conceptualized as files inserted into folders, as if they are independent objects that fit neatly into a hierarchical structure. Even if a file conceptually belongs to multiple categories, it can only exist in one. If it is insisted that it belongs to more than one, then just as with a paper file, that digital file must be copied to the clipboard and pasted into another folder, and we now have two separate copies. Concepts and practices derived from paper documents have been transferred into the digital realm, inheriting the biases and material constraints. It begins at the computer operating system level but permeates the digital realm.The problem is not that concepts derived from paper documents have been transferred to the digital realm, but how they have been transferred. This problem led to the research question: What new approaches can be taken to representational concepts for mapping and accessing the interconnective structure of documents to enable new ways of traversing documents through interaction, and what are the consequences?The method is based on an iterative process of content creation, concept design, and creating interactive prototypes of a digital document system. An interactive prototype of a digital document system has been developed by taking new approaches to representational concepts for mapping and accessing the interconnective structure of documents. The concepts have been derived through examining prominent document systems considered influential in the evolution of information technologies:  The Encyclopédie by Denis Diderot (1713-84) and Jean d’Alembert (1717-83)  The work of Paul Otlet (1868-1944)  The original hypertext project Xanadu by Ted Nelson (1937)All three are grounded in particular notions about the structure of ideas and how knowledge evolves (discussed below). Distilled from these examples, Nexae was developed based on the following conditions:1. Documents are modular.The structure of ideas is multi-sequential, and knowledge is not fundamentally hierarchical. Subsequently, it was established that a digital document system must support mapping multiple structures, and hierarchy should not be the predominant structure into which content must fit. Knowledge is a process of decomposition and recomposition (analysis and synthesis). To realize the interconnective structure of documents and to facilitate that continuous process of decomposition and recomposition, Nexae was developed based on the conception that documents are modular.2. There are multiple renditions of content.Different view modes were developed to convey different information about the interconnective structure of documents, which, together with the capability to filter documents and links, offer multiple renditions of content.3. Links are distinguished according to types of connections.To facilitate the modularization of documents, links were conceptually and visually distinguished according to types of connections. Those links could be applied to realize the interconnective structure of documents, providing access through interaction.4. It is a closed system.For the system to support the developed concepts and how they interact, Nexae is envisioned as a closed system (i.e., no external links).Development of the Concepts and the PrototypeMultiple Renditions Implemented as Two View ModesTwo view modes were developed to convey different information about the interconnective structure of documents, enabling zooming in and out to gain different perspectives on (and representations of) documents at different levels of detail. Zoomed-Out View is at the document collection level, and the Zoomed-In View is at the document level.Model of Zoomed-Out ViewZoomed-Out View is a network diagram using a node-link model. All documents are viewed in relation to each other, conveying information about the size of each document (indicated by the node size) and the number of links (indicated by line thickness). Functioning as an infographic, it allows understanding a lot of information at a glance. The idea with this view mode is that it should be possible to configure the node-link structure based on document (and link) metadata. Documents could be grouped in clusters according to a shared subject, keywords, or writer name.Model of Zoomed-Out View, cluster arrangementAlternatively, the node-link structure could be arranged in the form of a timeline based on the date of creation or the date last modified.*Model of Zoomed-Out View, timeline arrangement**From Zoomed-Out View, a document could be selected to enter Zoomed-In View. In Zoomed-In View, the selected document is viewed in more detail, conveying information about the type of connections to/from that document.Model of Zoomed-In ViewTwo Link Types: Transclusions and Non-TransclusionsTwo link types were first developed based on two distinct types of connections: reused content items across documents (transclusions) and arbitrary conceptual connections (non-transclusions).Transclusion is the inclusion of (a part of) a document into another document. In Nexae, content is transcluded rather than copied and pasted. And unlike the copy/paste method, when content items are transcluded, an automatic link is generated, keeping track and providing direct access to its original context. In line with the conception of documents as modular, through transclusion, a content item can exist in multiple documents. Transclusions enable, for example, a content item to be the third list item in one document and the title of the fifth section in another document.Model of transclusions, allowing content items to exist in multiple documentsDifferent document versions will have shared content items, which are also transclusions. Content that is by convention inserted between quotation marks or in a block quote, for example, is a form of transclusion. Transclusions also include connections that exist between content transiting between different versions. The image below shows two different drafts and a document with reference material.Both link types were developed with the capacity to point to an entire document or a particular part of a document.In contrast, on the web, it is only possible to create links at the document level (i.e., at the webpage level). Even if a sentence refers to a particular part, it is not possible to link directly to it.Model of a sentence referring to a particular part of another webpageSelecting a link, therefore, results in blindly landing on the top of a webpage.Model of selecting a link and landing on the top of another webpageAt this stage, the prototype had two link types.Prototype with two link types: transclusions (dashed lines) and non-transclusions (solid lines)Alteration to Non-Transclusion Type LinksThe type of connections that are not transclusions could be further subcategorized, for example, as a comment, reference, tangent, definition, a lateral line of thought, or an opposing view.Model of subcategorized non-transclusionsInstead of developing link types for every potential type of connection that is not transclusion, one link type (called taglink) was developed to accommodate them all.Model of two link types: transclusion and taglinkUtilizing the common usage of hashtags, taglinks offer a way to describe the connection by attaching a label, enabling a grouping mechanism and the capability to filter to view a subset of the document collection based on any taxonomy.Filtering Documents and LinksAt this stage, links and documents could be filtered in a side menu (seen in the demo below).Filtering in a side menuFiltering by right-clicking directly on the links and selecting a taglink label (seen in the demo below) was also possible.Filtering by selecting a taglink labelRepresenting Linked Documents as AliasesAt this stage, there are two main issues with the prototype. One issue was the visual incoherency of the crisscrossing lines, not offering much information about the connection for easy access. The other issue had to do with how linked documents are represented as icons (seen in the image below), not providing a preview of the link endpoint.Prototype showing linked document as a preview iconAnother representation of linked documents was explored: visualizing linked documents as aliases.Model of opening a document (2) with linked documents represented as aliases (1,3)The image above shows single links between 1 and 3 and between 1 and 2. Between 2 and 3, there are two links. Selecting document 2 results in document 3 spawning into two aliases on the side of 2.As seen in the two demos below, an animation showing a document splitting into two was implemented to indicate multiple aliases of the same document.Demo of opening a document with linked documents splitting into aliases (version 1)Demo of opening a document with linked documents splitting into aliases (version 2)Discarding the crisscrossing lines, Zoomed-In View was redesigned based on the diagrammatic visual language of concept maps, such that the taglink label is shown when the cursor hovers a linked document (seen in the demo below).Zoomed-In View: Hovering linked documents shows the taglink labelApplying a Diagrammatic Visual Language to Convey the Link Direction and Link EndpointTo convey further information about a connection, the link direction and endpoint were also applied through a diagrammatic visual language.Link direction denotes whether:  a connection is established to a document, or  from a document.Link endpoints denotes whether there is a connection to:  an entire document or  a part of a document.Most common on the web are one-directional links pointing to another (external) website or (internal) webpage. Since links do not indicate the destination, once it has been selected, the only way to retrieve the original webpage is to select the back button in the browser to navigate back.Less common are backlinks, often implemented in what is called digital gardens. Backlinks are links that point from another document. If Document A contains a link to Document B, then Document B contains a backlink to Document A. Roam Research is known for popularizing backlinks, and others like Notion have followed suit. Usually, backlinks are presented in a list and commonly at the bottom, as seen in the three following images.In the example above, selecting a backlink results in instantly landing on a page. In the example below, selecting backlinks results in the document opening on the side, enabling a comparison of the two linked documents without leaving the document.In Notion, backlinks are hidden in a list that only expands upon deliberate action. Additionally, the list is underneath the title, not at the bottom.In all these examples, links pointing outward are inline hyperlinks. Links pointing inward are in a separate list, which means that the backlinks do not make available where exactly the document has been mentioned (the link endpoint) nor how many times.In Nexae, outward and inward links are not separated; both are inline, with the arrow symbol indicating the link direction. Additionally, because links can be attached at the content item level, unlike backlinks, the endpoint of a link provides direct access to the particular part of a document.Zoomed-In View (with a location frame of Zoomed-Out View in the upper-right corner)An arrow symbol indicates the link direction. A line with a bracket indicates that the link points to the entire document, and a line without a bracket indicates it points to a particular part, and that particular part is shown in the alias window. For example, in the image below, a taglink connects the term transclusion to a document in which it is defined, which is appropriately labeled source.Example of a taglink in NexaeAnd in the image below is a transclusion type link showing the original context of the reused sentence fragment.Example of transclusion in NexaeBecause all links are bidirectional, selecting an alias to access the original context means that it also links back (as seen in the demo below).Traversing by selecting a transclusionA Third Link Type: SeqlinkAt this stage, sequences of content items within documents can be nested to create a hierarchical structure. However, the two link types (transclusion and taglink) do not offer a way to set a sequence at the document level. To that end, another link type was developed (seqlinks), enabling establishing the order of documents in a sequence.Model of the three link types: transclusion, taglink, and seqlinkDetermining the order of documents in a sequence, seqlinks accordingly point to the previous or the next document in a sequence. In combination with headings within a document, seqlinks allow the possibility of creating hierarchical structures. The sequential order of documents (and the possible hierarchical order of content items within a document) co-exists with the order offered by the other two link types. Seqlinks also enables the arrangement of the node-link structure (in Zoomed-Out View) to show the intended sequential order of documents (seen in the demo below).Zoomed-Out View, node-link structure arranged according to seqlinksWhile in Zoomed-In View, it is possible to traverse documents by selecting seqlinks, as seen in the demo below. The location frame (in the upper right corner) shows which document is currently open (including linked documents as active links) in that sequence.Traversing documents by selecting seqlinksCurrent State of the PrototypeIn the current state of the prototype, there are three link types and two view modes in which it is possible to filter documents and links.Three Link Types: Transclusions, Taglinks, and SeqlinksAll links are implemented through a diagrammatic visual language, specifically lines with arrow symbols to denote the direction, and taglinks and transclusions have alias windows showing the linked document. To convey further information about a connection, beyond the three link types, there are two link directions and two link endpoints, also conveyed through a diagrammatical visual language. The direction of a link is indicated by an arrow symbol. The link endpoints describe whether there is a connection to an entire document or a part of a document, providing direct access to that particular part. A bracketed line indicates that the link is attached to the entire document; an unbracketed line indicates that the link is attached to a particular content item within the document.Switching View ModesSwitching view modes involves transition animations suggesting the movement of zooming in and out on documents. Switching from Zoomed-Out View to Zoomed-In View is done by opening a document, equivalent to zooming in on a document.In Zoomed-In View, the selected document is viewed in more detail, conveying information about the type of connections to/from that document.Traversing DocumentsWhile in Zoomed-In View (i.e., having opened a document), opening a linked document by selecting one of its aliases also brings about a transition animation (seen in the demo below). Additionally, a location frame shows the open document as an active node seen through the perspective of Zoomed-Out View (in the upper-right corner). The location frame, originating with cartography, is implemented to support orientation.In contrast, opening webpages by selecting hyperlinks occurs instantly (i.e., landing on a page without a transition animation) and does not make the destination explicitly apparent. Some implementations on the web attempt to make the destination of links more apparent, such as the preview windows seen in Wikipedia (but only for internal links, i.e., other Wikipedia pages).These windows support quick decision-making for opening a link based on whether it is relevant content. However, these preview windows pop up and overlap the content, demanding attention and requiring deliberate action to get a glimpse. To circumvent these issues, Jeff Kaufman implemented preview windows so that they appear in a side panel rather than on top of the content.In Nexae, linked documents are idle aliases that are always visible (unless hidden by filtering links and documents). Additionally, the preview windows in the examples above only show the top part of the linked webpage, not indicating whether the connection points to a particular part.In Nexae, links can be attached on the document level but also at the content item level. Aliases can therefore bring into view the particular content item to/from which the open document is linked. The visual form of the link additionally aids in conveying whether the connection points to the entire document or a part of the document. As seen in the image below, a bracketed line indicates that it is attached to the entire document. An unbracketed line indicates that it is linked to a particular content item within the document (in which case, the linked content item is shown in purple).The means of visually distinguishing different categories of information is by convention done typographically. The main text has a large font size, and additional information, such as footnotes, has a small font size, implying a hierarchical relationship. In Nexae, information categories are assigned through the three link types, not a predefined hierarchical structure. So information that is by convention embedded as footnotes would be in separate documents to which metadata can be attached and a taglink label that describes the content and the connection(s). There is no implicit hierarchy, and through filtering, it is possible to view a subcategory of the additional information.Filtering Documents and LinksBoth documents and links can be filtered (based on metadata) so that only a subset of the document collection is shown.Filtering by documents by author and links by taglink labelIt may be useful, for example, to view only documents with the tag #terminology (seen in the demo below), or it may be useful to view only transclusions and taglinks labeled #source, which ultimately means looking only at connections to content items that are extracted or paraphrased or based on reference material.Filtering by documents by author and links by taglink labelSystem of Internal Links, No External LinksTo support the developed concepts and how they interact, Nexae is envisioned as a closed system.To compare, websites built with wiki structures, such as digital gardens and Wikipedia, are very similar to the encyclopedia by Diderot in that they are semi-closed systems, meaning there is an emphasis on internal links, although establishing external links is possible. In both examples, internal and external links are somehow visually distinguished. In the Wikipedia system, internal links (links to other Wikipedia pages) are implemented as hyperlinks in the main text or panels with other categories of information located on the side of the main text. External links, which can be connections by reference or arbitrary connections, are implemented as footnotes, and the links are located at the bottom of the webpage. Selecting an external link results in leaving Wikipedia, whether that be a link to download a PDF or opening another website in another browser tab.Digital gardens also contain internal and external links, applied as inline links and commonly visually distinguished. External links are visually distinguished from internal links by the northeast arrow symbol, as seen in the image below.In sum, Wikipedia has two main link types (external and internal), distinguished through layout design.Model of internal and external link mechanisms in WikipediaNexae has been designed with no external links because, in order to have direct access to a linked document, it must exist in Nexae. Content is added rather than linked to external sources. The only distinction is between private documents (only accessible to the person who added them) and public (accessible to everyone or a selection of people in Nexae).Model of internal links (that can be private or public) in NexaeIn the next entry, further developments are proposed.",

Subsequently, it was established that a digital document system must support mapping multiple structures, and hierarchy should not be the predominant structure into which content must fit. Knowledge is a process of decomposition and recomposition (analysis and synthesis). To realize the interconnective structure of documents and to facilitate that continuous process of decomposition and recomposition, Nexae was developed based on the conception that documents are modular.</p><p><strong>2. There are multiple renditions of content.</strong></p><p>Different view modes were developed to convey different information about the interconnective structure of documents, which, together with the capability to filter documents and links, offer multiple renditions of content.</p><p><strong>3. Links are distinguished according to types of connections.</strong></p><p>To facilitate the modularization of documents, links were conceptually and visually distinguished according to types of connections. Those links could be applied to realize the interconnective structure of documents, providing access through interaction.</p><p><strong>4. It is a closed system.</strong></p><p>For the system to support the developed concepts and how they interact, Nexae is envisioned as a closed system (i.e., no external links).</p><h2 id=\"development-of-the-concepts-and-the-prototype\">Development of the Concepts and the Prototype</h2><h3 id=\"multiple-renditions-implemented-as-two-view-modes\">Multiple Renditions Implemented as Two View Modes</h3><p>Two view modes were developed to convey different information about the interconnective structure of documents, enabling zooming in and out to gain different perspectives on (and representations of) documents at different levels of detail. Zoomed-Out View is at the document collection level, and the Zoomed-In View is at the document level.</p><p><img src=\"assets/rendition01.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Model of Zoomed-Out View</em></p><p>Zoomed-Out View is a network diagram using a node-link model. All documents are viewed in relation to each other, conveying information about the size of each document (indicated by the node size) and the number of links (indicated by line thickness). Functioning as an infographic, it allows understanding a lot of information at a glance. The idea with this view mode is that it should be possible to configure the node-link structure based on document (and link) metadata. Documents could be grouped in clusters according to a shared subject, keywords, or writer name.</p><p><img src=\"assets/rendition02.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Model of Zoomed-Out View, cluster arrangement</em></p><p>Alternatively, the node-link structure could be arranged in the form of a timeline based on the date of creation or the date last modified.</p><p><img src=\"assets/rendition03.png\" alt=\"\" />*Model of Zoomed-Out View, timeline arrangement**</p><p>From Zoomed-Out View, a document could be selected to enter Zoomed-In View. In Zoomed-In View, the selected document is viewed in more detail, conveying information about the type of connections to/from that document.</p><p><img src=\"assets/rendition05.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Model of Zoomed-In View</em></p><h3 id=\"two-link-types-transclusions-and-non-transclusions\">Two Link Types: Transclusions and Non-Transclusions</h3><p>Two link types were first developed based on two distinct types of connections: reused content items across documents (transclusions) and arbitrary conceptual connections (non-transclusions).</p><p>Transclusion is the inclusion of (a part of) a document into another document. In Nexae, content is <em>transcluded</em> rather than <em>copied</em> and <em>pasted</em>. And unlike the copy/paste method, when content items are transcluded, an automatic link is generated, keeping track and providing direct access to its original context. In line with the conception of documents as modular, through transclusion, a content item can exist in multiple documents. Transclusions enable, for example, a content item to be the third list item in one document and the title of the fifth section in another document.</p><p><img src=\"assets/transclusion_model_1.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Model of transclusions, allowing content items to exist in multiple documents</em></p><p>Different document versions will have shared content items, which are also transclusions. Content that is by convention inserted between quotation marks or in a block quote, for example, is a <em>form</em> of transclusion. Transclusions also include connections that exist between content transiting between different versions. The image below shows two different drafts and a document with reference material.</p><p><img src=\"assets/transclusion_model_2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>Both link types were developed with the capacity to point to an entire document or a particular part of a document.</p><p><img src=\"assets/modular_link_endpoints.png\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>In contrast, on the web, it is only possible to create links at the document level (i.e., at the webpage level). Even if a sentence refers to a particular part, it is not possible to link directly to it.</p><p><img src=\"assets/2_web_link_endpoint.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Model of a sentence referring to a particular part of another webpage</em></p><p>Selecting a link, therefore, results in blindly landing on the top of a webpage.</p><p><img src=\"assets/3_web_link_endpoint.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Model of selecting a link and landing on the top of another webpage</em></p><p>At this stage, the prototype had two link types.</p><p><img src=\"assets/round_1.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Prototype with two link types: transclusions (dashed lines) and non-transclusions (solid lines)</em></p><h4 id=\"alteration-to-non-transclusion-type-links\">Alteration to Non-Transclusion Type Links</h4><p>The type of connections that are not transclusions could be further subcategorized, for example, as a comment, reference, tangent, definition, a lateral line of thought, or an opposing view.</p><p><img src=\"assets/link_types_03 1.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Model of subcategorized non-transclusions</em></p><p>Instead of developing link types for every potential type of connection that is not transclusion, one link type (called taglink) was developed to accommodate them all.</p><p><img src=\"assets/link_types_two.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Model of two link types: transclusion and taglink</em></p><p>Utilizing the common usage of hashtags, taglinks offer a way to describe the connection by attaching a label, enabling a grouping mechanism and the capability to filter to view a subset of the document collection based on any taxonomy.</p><h3 id=\"filtering-documents-and-links\">Filtering Documents and Links</h3><p>At this stage, links and documents could be filtered in a side menu (seen in the demo below).</p><p><img src=\"assets/filter_in_menu.gif\" alt=\"\" /><em>Filtering in a side menu</em></p><p>Filtering by right-clicking directly on the links and selecting a taglink label (seen in the demo below) was also possible.</p><p><img src=\"assets/filter_click_link.gif\" alt=\"\" /><em>Filtering by selecting a taglink label</em></p><h3 id=\"representing-linked-documents-as-aliases\">Representing Linked Documents as Aliases</h3><p>At this stage, there are two main issues with the prototype. One issue was the visual incoherency of the crisscrossing lines, not offering much information about the connection for easy access. The other issue had to do with how linked documents are represented as icons (seen in the image below), not providing a preview of the link endpoint.</p><p><img src=\"assets/linked_document_preview.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Prototype showing linked document as a preview icon</em></p><p>Another representation of linked documents was explored: visualizing linked documents as aliases.</p><p><img src=\"assets/traversing_aliases.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Model of opening a document (2) with linked documents represented as aliases (1,3)</em></p><p>The image above shows single links between 1 and 3 and between 1 and 2. Between 2 and 3, there are two links. Selecting document 2 results in document 3 spawning into two aliases on the side of 2.</p><p>As seen in the two demos below, an animation showing a document splitting into two was implemented to indicate multiple aliases of the same document.</p><p><img src=\"assets/test_03_split_after 1.gif\" alt=\"\" /><em>Demo of opening a document with linked documents splitting into aliases (version 1)</em></p><p><img src=\"assets/test_03_split_before 1.gif\" alt=\"\" /><em>Demo of opening a document with linked documents splitting into aliases (version 2)</em></p><p>Discarding the crisscrossing lines, Zoomed-In View was redesigned based on the diagrammatic visual language of concept maps, such that the taglink label is shown when the cursor hovers a linked document (seen in the demo below).</p><p><img src=\"assets/test_03_purple_4_cut.gif\" alt=\"\" /><em>Zoomed-In View: Hovering linked documents shows the taglink label</em></p><h3 id=\"applying-a-diagrammatic-visual-language-to-convey-the-link-direction-and-link-endpoint\">Applying a Diagrammatic Visual Language to Convey the Link Direction and Link Endpoint</h3><p>To convey further information about a connection, the link direction and endpoint were also applied through a diagrammatic visual language.</p><p><strong>Link direction</strong> denotes whether:</p><ol>  <li>a connection is established <em>to</em> a document, or</li>  <li><em>from</em> a document.</li></ol><p><strong>Link endpoints</strong> denotes whether there is a connection to:</p><ol>  <li>an entire document or</li>  <li>a part of a document.</li></ol><p>Most common on the web are one-directional links pointing <em>to</em> another (external) website or (internal) webpage. Since links do not indicate the destination, once it has been selected, the only way to retrieve the original webpage is to select the back button in the browser to navigate back.</p><p>Less common are backlinks, often implemented in what is called digital gardens. <em>Backlinks</em> are links that point <em>from</em> another document. If <em>Document A</em> contains a link to <em>Document B</em>, then <em>Document B</em> contains a backlink to <em>Document A</em>. Roam Research is known for popularizing backlinks, and others like Notion have followed suit. Usually, backlinks are presented in a list and commonly at the bottom, as seen in the three following images.</p><p><img src=\"assets/backlinks_list_1.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>In the example above, selecting a backlink results in instantly <em>landing on a page</em>. In the example below, selecting backlinks results in the document opening on the side, enabling a comparison of the two linked documents without leaving the document.</p><p><img src=\"assets/backlinks_list_2.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>In Notion, backlinks are hidden in a list that only expands upon deliberate action. Additionally, the list is underneath the title, not at the bottom.</p><p><img src=\"assets/backlinks_list_3.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>In all these examples, links pointing outward are inline hyperlinks. Links pointing inward are in a separate list, which means that the backlinks do not make available where exactly the document has been mentioned (the link endpoint) nor how many times.</p><p>In Nexae, outward and inward links are not separated; both are inline, with the arrow symbol indicating the link direction. Additionally, because links can be attached at the content item level, unlike backlinks, the endpoint of a link provides direct access to the particular part of a document.</p><p><img src=\"assets/lateral_view.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Zoomed-In View (with a location frame of Zoomed-Out View in the upper-right corner)</em></p><p>An arrow symbol indicates the link direction. A line with a bracket indicates that the link points to the entire document, and a line without a bracket indicates it points to a particular part, and that particular part is shown in the alias window. For example, in the image below, a taglink connects the term <em>transclusion</em> to a document in which it is defined, which is appropriately labeled <em>source</em>.</p><p><img src=\"assets/example_taglink_hover.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Example of a taglink in Nexae</em></p><p>And in the image below is a transclusion type link showing the original context of the reused sentence fragment.</p><p><img src=\"assets/example_transclusion_hover.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Example of transclusion in Nexae</em></p><p>Because all links are bidirectional, selecting an alias to access the original context means that it also links back (as seen in the demo below).</p><p><img src=\"assets/3_traverse_by_transclusions.gif\" alt=\"\" /><em>Traversing by selecting a transclusion</em></p><h3 id=\"a-third-link-type-seqlink\">A Third Link Type: Seqlink</h3><p>At this stage, sequences of content items within documents can be nested to create a hierarchical structure. However, the two link types (transclusion and taglink) do not offer a way to set a sequence at the document level. To that end, another link type was developed (seqlinks), enabling establishing the order of documents in a sequence.</p><p><img src=\"assets/three_link_types.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Model of the three link types: transclusion, taglink, and seqlink</em></p><p>Determining the order of documents in a sequence, seqlinks accordingly point to the previous or the next document in a sequence. In combination with headings within a document, seqlinks allow the possibility of creating hierarchical structures. The sequential order of documents (and the possible hierarchical order of content items within a document) co-exists with the order offered by the other two link types. Seqlinks also enables the arrangement of the node-link structure (in Zoomed-Out View) to show the intended sequential order of documents (seen in the demo below).</p><p><img src=\"assets/arranged_by_sequence.gif\" alt=\"\" /><em>Zoomed-Out View, node-link structure arranged according to seqlinks</em></p><p>While in Zoomed-In View, it is possible to traverse documents by selecting seqlinks, as seen in the demo below. The location frame (in the upper right corner) shows which document is currently open (including linked documents as active links) in that sequence.</p><p><img src=\"assets/1_traverse_by_sequence_links.gif\" alt=\"\" /><em>Traversing documents by selecting seqlinks</em></p><h2 id=\"current-state-of-the-prototype\">Current State of the Prototype</h2><p>In the current state of the prototype, there are three link types and two view modes in which it is possible to filter documents and links.</p><h3 id=\"three-link-types-transclusions-taglinks-and-seqlinks\">Three Link Types: Transclusions, Taglinks, and Seqlinks</h3><p>All links are implemented through a diagrammatic visual language, specifically lines with arrow symbols to denote the direction, and taglinks and transclusions have alias windows showing the linked document. To convey further information about a connection, beyond the three link types, there are two link directions and two link endpoints, also conveyed through a diagrammatical visual language. The direction of a link is indicated by an arrow symbol. The link endpoints describe whether there is a connection to an entire document or a part of a document, providing direct access to that particular part. A bracketed line indicates that the link is attached to the entire document; an unbracketed line indicates that the link is attached to a particular content item within the document.</p><h3 id=\"switching-view-modes\">Switching View Modes</h3><p>Switching view modes involves transition animations suggesting the movement of zooming in and out on documents. Switching from Zoomed-Out View to Zoomed-In View is done by opening a document, equivalent to zooming in on a document.</p><p><img src=\"assets/zooming.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>In Zoomed-In View, the selected document is viewed in more detail, conveying information about the type of connections to/from that document.</p><h3 id=\"traversing-documents\">Traversing Documents</h3><p>While in Zoomed-In View (i.e., having opened a document), opening a linked document by selecting one of its aliases also brings about a transition animation (seen in the demo below). Additionally, a location frame shows the open document as an active node seen through the perspective of Zoomed-Out View (in the upper-right corner). The location frame, originating with cartography, is implemented to support orientation.</p><p><img src=\"assets/selecting_alias.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>In contrast, opening webpages by selecting hyperlinks occurs instantly (i.e., <em>landing on a page</em> without a transition animation) and does not make the destination explicitly apparent. Some implementations on the web attempt to make the destination of links more apparent, such as the preview windows seen in Wikipedia (but only for internal links, i.e., other Wikipedia pages).</p><p><img src=\"assets/preview_on_top.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>These windows support quick decision-making for opening a link based on whether it is relevant content. However, these preview windows pop up and overlap the content, demanding attention and requiring deliberate action to get a glimpse. To circumvent these issues, Jeff Kaufman implemented preview windows so that they appear in a side panel rather than on top of the content.</p><p><img src=\"assets/preview_on_side.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>In Nexae, linked documents are idle aliases that are always visible (unless hidden by filtering links and documents). Additionally, the preview windows in the examples above only show the top part of the linked webpage, not indicating whether the connection points to a particular part.</p><p>In Nexae, links can be attached on the document level but also at the content item level. Aliases can therefore bring into view the particular content item to/from which the open document is linked. The visual form of the link additionally aids in conveying whether the connection points to the entire document or a part of the document. As seen in the image below, a bracketed line indicates that it is attached to the entire document. An unbracketed line indicates that it is linked to a particular content item within the document (in which case, the linked content item is shown in purple).</p><p><img src=\"assets/bracket_link_endpoint.png\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>The means of visually distinguishing different categories of information is by convention done typographically. The main text has a large font size, and additional information, such as footnotes, has a small font size, implying a hierarchical relationship. In Nexae, information categories are assigned through the three link types, not a predefined hierarchical structure. So information that is by convention embedded as footnotes would be in separate documents to which metadata can be attached and a taglink label that describes the content and the connection(s). There is no implicit hierarchy, and through filtering, it is possible to view a subcategory of the additional information.</p><h2 id=\"filtering-documents-and-links-1\">Filtering Documents and Links</h2><p>Both documents and links can be filtered (based on metadata) so that only a subset of the document collection is shown.</p><p><img src=\"assets/filtering.gif\" alt=\"\" /><em>Filtering by documents by author and links by taglink label</em></p><p>It may be useful, for example, to view only documents with the tag <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">#terminology</code> (seen in the demo below), or it may be useful to view only transclusions and taglinks labeled <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">#source</code>, which ultimately means looking only at connections to content items that are extracted or paraphrased or based on reference material.</p><p><img src=\"assets/5_basic_filtering.gif\" alt=\"\" /><em>Filtering by documents by author and links by taglink label</em></p><h3 id=\"system-of-internal-links-no-external-links\">System of Internal Links, No External Links</h3><p>To support the developed concepts and how they interact, Nexae is envisioned as a closed system.</p><p>To compare, websites built with wiki structures, such as digital gardens and Wikipedia, are very similar to the encyclopedia by Diderot in that they are semi-closed systems, meaning there is an emphasis on internal links, although establishing external links is possible. In both examples, internal and external links are somehow visually distinguished. In the Wikipedia system, internal links (links to other Wikipedia pages) are implemented as hyperlinks in the main text or panels with other categories of information located on the side of the main text. External links, which can be connections by reference or arbitrary connections, are implemented as footnotes, and the links are located at the bottom of the webpage. Selecting an external link results in leaving Wikipedia, whether that be a link to download a PDF or opening another website in another browser tab.</p><p><img src=\"assets/wikipedia_internal_external_links.png\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>Digital gardens also contain internal and external links, applied as inline links and commonly visually distinguished. External links are visually distinguished from internal links by the northeast arrow symbol, as seen in the image below.</p><p><img src=\"assets/example_internal_external_distinction.png\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>In sum, Wikipedia has two main link types (external and internal), distinguished through layout design.</p><p><img src=\"assets/wikipedia_semi-open_system.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Model of internal and external link mechanisms in Wikipedia</em></p><p>Nexae has been designed with no external links because, in order to have direct access to a linked document, it must exist in Nexae. Content is added rather than linked to external sources. The only distinction is between private documents (only accessible to the person who added them) and public (accessible to everyone or a selection of people in Nexae).</p><p><img src=\"assets/nexae_closed_system.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Model of internal links (that can be private or public) in Nexae</em></p><p>In the <a href=\"20\">next entry</a>, further developments are proposed.</p>",

There may be an intended content-item-by-content-item sequence, in conventional terms, paragraph-by-paragraph, list-item-by-list-item, and so on. Several other structures also exist and can be (and usually are) mapped.For example, in conventional terms, the order of a set of chapters and subchapters is the sequential order intended by the writer.One chapter may be the last in one sequence (of chapters) and the second in (and adapted for) another sequence (of chapters). In this case — conceptualized as a chapter — it is the same set of points with some differences existing in two places (i.e., sequences). These two versions are inherently connected. Further, within that sequential order, there can be reused content items from other sources or other categories of information that point to internal or external content items (conventionally embedded and visually distinguished from the main text). Mapping those various connections results in an interconnective structure, offering multiple sequences of documents and content items.  It should be noted, furthermore, that while a novel on paper is far from being automatically linear, a hypertext is not necessarily nonlinear. The pages or segments may be rigorously sequential, forcing the reader to read them in a fixed order, one even more fixed than that of the pages of a book, because it is always possible to open a book to any page one wishes while a hypertext can be programmed to totally control the reader’s path. This said, hypertext by nature lends itself ideally to a variety of reading paths and to multisequential navigation.

Labels can be attached to links (called taglinks)While in Inventory View, selecting a node opens a document. Selecting another node will close the already-open document and open the other. There are two versions of how this might look and work.1From Inventory View to Lateral ModeVersion 1In the image above, the linked documents are always visible and join in the middle of the open document.Version 2The image below shows an alternate version in which the linked documents are only visible when hovering on a link in the open document (called Vertical View).In both versions, if a link is selected within an open document, the corresponding document is opened, and the linked content items align (in Lateral Mode).Open/Close MechanismWhile in Lateral Mode, if another link within one of the two open documents is selected, the other document closes, and the corresponding document opens. This open/close mechanism allows traveling by links while retaining one document as the main document. The main document is always the document from which a link is selected. In the image below, the open/close mechanism is shown.Only the first-level linked nodes of an open document are visible in Lateral Mode. As indicated in the last step in the image above, closing a document will hide its linked nodes unless linked to one of the open documents.Lateral Mode (as in the lateral reading strategy) enables checking the original context of a transcluded content item through deliberate action. Using taglinks makes it possible to filter which link types should be shown/hidden. This means traveling by a link path is possible according to a selected tag (e.g., #comment, #elaboration, #definition).Demo VideoIn version 1, the neighboring documents are always shown, whereas in version 2, hovering on a link shows documents as nodes on the side.Version 1Version 2ReflectionIn version 2, hovering on a link to show (documents represented as) nodes in Vertical Mode is not particularly useful since the size is only informative when seen in relation to other nodes.In the next entry, the representation of linked documents is explored further.Discarded AttemptsOpening a Document in Inventory ViewIn the video below, the links are visualized as vertical lines on each side of the document. The thickness of the lines corresponds with the number of linked content items. One of the drawbacks is that too much information is visualized simultaneously.The video below demonstrates a slow transition from Inventory View to Vertical Mode. The question here is, what is the best way to animate a link within an open document to a closed document? In this example, hovering on a link extends the line to the content item within the open document, and the closed document (node) scales up. A drawback is that the scaling effect does not immediately capture attention.Attempts at Visualizing Opening a Document in Vertical ModeOnce in Vertical Mode, the selected link opens the corresponding document. The question is how the linked content objects should interact. In this example, upon opening a document by selecting a link, the linked content objects align, and the links fade out. The alignment of the content items may suffice.Endnotes            This is similar to when selecting a website URL from the bookmarks library in a browser results in replacing the currently open webpage. It is possible to open a new browser tab. However, the difference here is that the documents can be opened in the same window, and the connections are visual links. &#8617;      ",

            "content_text": "The first section of this entry introduces the concept of interconnection, the various terms used to express the idea of interconnection across fields, and the underlying philosophical position.The second section examines prominent document systems comprising concepts for mapping the interconnective structure of documents. Those concepts are juxtaposed to how they have been implemented in commonly known systems, such as how hypertext is implemented on the web. The biases and conventions inherited from paper documents are also discussed, including the (dis)advantages of transferring these (or how these have been transferred) to the digital realm.The aim is to gather insight into which features of the systems can be utilized, which is discussed in the third section. The motivation behind this approach resonates with what Mary Hopper stated in her introduction to the 1998 symposium Hypertext in Historical Context: Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson Revisited:  Consider that there may be vast potentials in electronic media that we still haven’t implemented, and we may be in danger of missing some of the greatest potential in electronic media because we mistake some situational limitations in technical development or project management for impossibility. This is the grounds upon which I suggest that the past is of more than just historical interest. The past, and the pioneers who shaped the past, may hold many suggestions as to paths it might be valuable to explore in the future and advice on the most productive ways to go down those paths. (Hopper 1998)  Documents and Interconnection  Examination of Prominent Document Systems          The Encyclopédie by Denis Diderot (1713 - 1784) and Jean d’Alembert (1717 - 1783)      The work of Paul Otlet (1868 - 1944)      The original hypertext project Xanadu by Ted Nelson (1937)        Insights1. Documents and InterconnectionThe concept of interconnection here denotes the various connections among documents’ content items1. As Ted Nelson (1987) explains, connections can be internal or external to a document, stated implicitly or explicitly. For example, phrases such as “in the example given below” or “as defined previously” establish implicit internal connections. Explicit internal connections are content items that, by convention, take the form of a footnote — the content of which can be a commentary on an idea, clarification of a term, parenthetical information, and suchlike. Explicit external connections are inclusions of one document segment into another (what Nelson (1980) coined transclusions) or some other direct connection by way of reference (paraphrased content with a citation, for example). Interconnection thus implies multiple potential structures other than the content-item-by-content-item sequence in a document (or, in conventional terms, the paragraph-by-paragraph sequence).Other terms express similar notions about the various connections between documents. As Borgman (2015) writes, “[t]he body of relationships among documents is sometimes known as ‘hypertextuality.’” Hypertext is commonly associated with how it has been implemented on the web, understood in general terms as “a computer construct of links and data corresponding to files or parts of files that can be displayed in windows of various dimensions (Vandendorpe 2009).” Another term, used particularly within semiotics and literary theory, is intertextuality which describes abstract connections “as in the influence of one text on the meaning of another” (Borgman 2015). One such connection can be how one text is derived from a preceding text, as with Ulysses by James Joyce, which is a transformation of Odyssey by Homer (Vandendorpe 2009). In the definition of an intertext as it was first proposed, there is an emphasis on the perception of the reader, namely that the connections between one text and one that preceded or followed it results from the activity of reading (Vanderndorpe 2009). Ted Nelson (2015) calls it intertwingularity which “expresses a philosophical position about cross-connection,” namely that “all subjects and issues are intertwined and intermingled.”Hypertextuality, intertextuality, and intertwingularity coincide but not completely. These terms are similar yet different lenses (used within particular fields) to express the idea that  documents do not stand alone, even if they look like independent objects. Rather, they are deeply connected to many other objects. (Borgman 2015)Interconnection is a general term chosen and used to encompass these various connections between documents that ultimately result in complex layers of information. These connections can be established through reading and writing but also computational methods, such as applying natural language processing techniques for classifying text and keyword extraction. In the next section, prominent analog and digital document systems.2. Examination of Prominent Document SystemsIn what follows, three document systems are examined to gather insight into which features can be utilized to create an interactive prototype of a digital document system for mapping and accessing the interconnective structure of documents.  The Encyclopédie by Denis Diderot (1713-84) and Jean d’Alembert (1717-83)  The work of Paul Otlet (1868-1944)  The original hypertext project Xanadu by Ted Nelson (1937)All three are considered influential in the evolution of information technologies. The encyclopedia by Diderot and d’Alembert is exemplary of the eighteenth century; the work of Otlet is exemplary of the nineteenth century; and Xanadu by Nelson of the twentieth century. All are grounded in particular notions about the structure of ideas and how knowledge evolves, reflected particularly in the conceptualization of documents as modular — made up of parts connected to other parts through some link mechanism.1 The Encyclopédie by Denis Diderot (1713-84) and Jean d’Alembert (1717-83)Various information technologies for mapping the interconnective structure, allowing access through (non-)hierarchical renditions of contents, were produced in the eighteenth century, ranging from atlases, encyclopedias, dictionaries, and suchlike.Published between 1751 and 1772, the encyclopedia by Diderot and d’Alembert was, as Rosenberg (2015) argues, an innovative system for its time, utilizing textual and diagrammatic ways of mapping multiple structures.In its entirety, their encyclopedia is a system of intraconnections — which is to say, a closed system of internal connections — “comprising 28 volumes, 72,000 articles by over 2,000 writers, and more than 3,000 plates” (Rosenberg 2015). Though the design incorporates concepts for representing external connections, their encyclopedia was conceived and meant to be used as an independent system. A significant feature is the multiple renditions of the contents, offering multiple entry points to the articles. One structure is the alphabetical structure, embedded as running heads throughout the volumes (seen in the image below), allowing access to content by keyword.Image source: Internet ArchiveOther structures are the various diagrams, offering different renditions of the contents, such as the tree diagram from the first volume seen in the image below, functioning as a visual index.Image source: Internet ArchiveThese textual and diagrammatic ways of mapping structures are hierarchical, as was the convention at the time. However, as Rosenberg explains:  Older encyclopedias were generally organized hierarchically and by subject. Theirs was designed to be navigated by keyword, to allow readers to enter and exit at any useful point. Additionally, their encyclopedia was hypertexted. Articles were linked in a web through a system of renvois or cross-references. The Encyclopédie also offered a hierarchical subject map, echoing the structure of older works, but, in the work of Diderot and d’Alembert, the tree of knowledge was presented as only one of several heuristics. (Rosenberg 2015)The other structure — the implementation of cross-references — is a system of internal connections linking articles together. Within this system, there are two types of internal connections. The first type of connection is recommendations for further reading on related subjects and topics, linking together, as Diderot put it, “…Dialectics to Metaphysics; Metaphysics to Theology; Theology to Jurisprudence; Jurisprudence to History; History to Geography and Chronology […]” (Curran 2019) and so on. The second type of connection “put contradictory articles into dialogue,” for example, the article Freedom of Thought is linked to Diderot’s article Intolerance (of the Christian Church), inviting the “reader to cultivate a critical viewpoint” (Curran 2019). As the computer-generated diagram (seen in the image below) further elucidates, implicit in the system of internal connections is an underlying network structure.Diagram by Olsen and Blanchard (Image source: Rosenberg (2015))Additionally, the diagram elucidates that conceiving knowledge as fundamentally hierarchical is not “paradigmatic of Enlightenment epistemology,” nor is it intrinsic to print (Rosenberg 2015). Rather, all subjects are interconnected, and as Rosenberg argues, though the  network diagram would not have been familiar to the generation of the Encyclopedists, the concepts behind it were. They too were thinking about intellectual phenomena in terms of underlying structures and aggregate relationships. (Rosenberg 2015)2  The work of Paul Otlet (1868-1944)The work of Paul Otlet — regarded as a pioneer of the field once called documentation that branched into what is now called information science (Le Deuff and Perret 2019) — developed new approaches to organizing and accessing information by devising models2 and establishing theoretical principles of information. Otlet also explored how information organization might be in the future (once media other than the book would take precedence) in the form of metaphorical illustrations of a global network of documents (Heuvel and Rayward 2011).Similar to the Encyclopédie — a project that is seen as in response to the eighteenth-century information overload (Rosenberg 2015) — Otlet’s work was in response to the nineteenth-century problem of “the enormous growth in the number of publications, specialist congresses, and international exhibitions” (Manfroid 2013). The problem that Otlet analyzed and explored solutions to was “how most effectively to create, maintain, and change institutional arrangements for collecting, storing, preserving, organizing, retrieving, and disseminating all of the recorded information that is — or will be — needed within society” (Rayward 1994). With that complex problem at hand, Otlet envisioned new approaches to storing, organizing, and disseminating information.Otlet conceptualized documents as modular — made up of parts connected to other parts. An appropriate system, according to Otlet, must therefore allow and facilitate establishing links between these parts (i.e., content items). In designing such a system, Otlet explored the re-conceptualization of the Book as a global system of documents. As told by Heuvel and Rayward:  In a 1911 lecture on the future of the book and of bibliography, Otlet came back to the idea he had first expressed in 1892 and in subsequent publications: ‘The arbitrary division into lines and pages of the book in its present format, does not at all correspond all with the presentation of ideas’ (p. 291). He envisioned the emergence of a future format of the book in which ‘each intellectual element, in corresponding to a physical element, will create a structure such that any combination of ideas, notions, and facts will be possible.’ He suggested that this process can operate in so mechanical a fashion that in the future, the book will truly become a machine to think with (Otlet in Heuvel and Rayward (2011))As the illustrations below suggest, for Otlet, the development of such a system entails ripping content items (representing ideas, notions, facts) from books and collecting each on separate paper cards.Global Network of Universal Documentation (Image source: Heuvel and Rayward (2011))The illustration below expresses a similar notion about how knowledge evolves.Title and Source%%find source%%Otlet conceived knowledge as a process of decomposition and recomposition (analysis and synthesis). A document system must facilitate this continuous process by accommodating expansive growth and extensive reuse. One of his explorations includes a paper card-based system (seen in the image below) in which multiple links can be established to and from a card.Multidimensional card system (Image source: Heuvel and Rayward (2011))Connections between content items could be established through links and metadata. As Otlet writes:  To increase the number of sides, one might well abandon the rectangular form of the card and adopt a polygonal form, an octagon for example. For sorting and systematically selecting the ideas that have been classified hierarchically, the cards are suspended from their centre. The Book as a structure of cards thus takes a quasi-circular form and can rotate. [I]ts structure […] constitutes a Book […] that has abandoned the traditional form of linear text arranged according to a unique plan. It has been transformed in some way into a body with several dimensions, as many dimensions as headings such that different searches using the same graphic elements on the cards are possible. (Otlet in Heuvel and Rayward (2011))As Heuvel and Rayward (2011) point out, the material manifestation of such a paper card system is “impractical for many reasons.” However, what Otlet describes is an open system in which many (types of) connections to and from the same content item (card) can be established through a link mechanism, forming an interconnective structure of documents. Beyond these experiments with paper cards, Otlet envisioned new visual representations of knowledge as a process of decomposition and recomposition. For example, as seen in the image below, “Otlet uses the architectural metaphor of the factory to visualize this process” (Heuvel 2017).Laboratorium Mundaneum (Image source: Wikimedia Commons)Though the material constraints of paper-based technologies inhibited Otlet (e.g., books, paper cards, shelves, cabinets, and desks), he envisioned new ways of organizing and accessing information beyond what Adriaan van der Weel (2012) calls the order of the book.33 The original hypertext project Xanadu by Ted Nelson (1937)Nelson is most known for inventing the back button, and developing concepts such as hypertext, virtuality, and the docuverse. Hypertext is likely the most known but is merely one of the many concepts Nelson has spent decades developing within a larger project called Xanadu. Though Xanadu has never been fully implemented, the many prototypes and writings throughout the decades since the 1960s have had a profound impact on the evolution of hypertext.4Xanadu is a hypertext system, a docuverse, technically a piece of software that, since its conception, has been designed to run on a global network of computers in which every document is to reside (Ridi 2018). Much akin to the work of Otlet, Xanadu is based on particular notions about how knowledge evolves and the structure of ideas. As Nelson writes:  The physical universe is not all that decays. So do abstraction and categories. Human ideas, science, scholarship, and language constantly collapsing and unfolding. Any field, and the corpus of all fields, is a bundle of relationships subject to all kinds of twists, inversions, involutions, and rearrangements. (Nelson 1965)According to Nelson, too, it is this continuous process that a system must be designed to accommodate by having the capacity for new categorization systems and any arrangements of old and new content. Further, on the structure of thoughts and ideas, Nelson writes:  [A]s you consider a thing, your thoughts crisscross it constantly, reviewing first one connection, then another. Each new idea is compared with many parts of the whole picture, or with some mental visualization of the whole picture itself. (Nelson 1987)In line with the notion that the structure of ideas is nonsequential, in his book Literary Machines (first published in 1980), Nelson defines hypertext as “nonsequential writing—text that branches and allows choices to the reader” (Nelson 1987). Whereas writing and structuring sequential text entails choosing “one expository sequence from among the possible myriad,” writing nonsequential text entails deciding on the “interconnective structure” — “where to put things in the searchable maze” (Nelson 1987). It is based on these definitions and notions about how ideas and knowledge evolve that Nelson envisioned Xanadu.Xanadu has gone through many revisions and different prototype implementations over six decades, but the core concepts have remained fundamentally the same. In what follows, those concepts are examined with reflections on some of the implementations and juxtaposed to how those concepts are implemented on the web.Integrated History ManagementXanadu is a system that stores (and makes accessible) every change made to documents, integrated in such a way that former states can be retrieved and reworked (Nelson 1987). As seen in the image below, people can choose whether those changes are local/private or online/public.Image source: Nelson (1987)Once a document is online/public, any changes made (e.g., if the writer revises the content, or readers reuse parts of a document or create links to/from a document) are stored; effectively, the history of every document is accessible to anyone. This would be the same if the web were built with an integrated history management system such as Git, not as an optional tool but as a core feature.Bidirectional Visual LinksThe multidimensional structure of Xanadu is designed for two main types of connections between documents, expressed by the two link types content links and transclusions. All links are implemented as bidirectional visual links. Content links are the arbitrary connections people (writers and readers) create as they engage with text, and transclusions are reused content items. By convention, transclusions are what are known as excerpts and typographically distinguished as block quotes or inline quotes, and the link between the copied and the pasted is usually embedded as a citation. However, as Nelson writes:  Transclusion is what quotation, copying and cross-referencing merely attempt: they are ways that people have had to imitate transclusion, which is the true abstract relationship that paper cannot show. (Nelson 1999)Content items are not duplicated; rather, transcluded — included in a document with a visual link to the original document. Since all links are bidirectional, every outward and inward-pointing link is accessible, which means the original document also points to documents that reuse parts of its contents. Transclusions offer a way to retrieve “the origins and context of quotations, excerpts and anthologized materials, and content transiting between versions” (Nelson 1999).On a technical level, links are not embedded but implemented as an overlay, much akin to “a cache, or an alias on the desktop” (Nelson 1999), enabling multiple overlapping links to the same (part of a) document. Additionally, because all changes are stored, even if the original document undergoes changes, it is always possible to view the content item in its original context at the time it was transcluded.In contrast, links on the web are embedded (in HTML) and only point outward. When a website is cited as a source in a text, it usually indicates the date the website was accessed. However, if the contents of the website have been deleted or changed since then, there is no way of accessing previous versions. Additionally, on the web, it is only possible to establish links at the document level (or page level)5 whereas, in Xanadu, link endpoints are at the level of the content item. As for how this would look and work, Nelson envisioned Xanadu as a system in which documents are viewed side-by-side with visual links, expressed by two concepts: parallel documents and transpointing windows (Nelson 1999).An improvement would be landing at the particular linked part of a document:Side-By-Side Documents With Visual LinksParallel documents, according to Nelson:  are everywhere, but are not generally acknowledged. There are relatively few explicitly parallel documents (like Tom Stoppard’s play “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead”, which is explicitly parallel to “Hamlet” – showing events that occur offstage in “Hamlet” and vice versa). But implicitly parallel documents are everywhere – the parallelism of commentaries, the parallelism of long and short versions of reports, the parallelism of translations, the parallelism of holy books. (Nelson 1998)Thus documents should be viewed side-by-side with transpointing windows to:  support analysis and detailed understanding – by parallel commentary, precise annotation and the explication of contents; by the facilitation of pinpoint controversy. These are needed not just in scholarship, but legislation, diplomacy, and anywhere that interrelated documents need to be seen[…for] detailed explication, commentary or disagreement[, and for] comparing successive versions of a document. (Nelson 1999)A prototype from 2003, in which the links are solid lines pointing to and from content items within windows, is seen in the image below.6Image source: Nelson (2015)In another prototype, the links are applied not as solid lines but as color-coded highlights. Additionally, the main document is in the middle, and the linked documents are on the left and right sides with a smaller font size.Screenshot of Xanadoc (try the interactive demo here)In the latest Xanadu prototype, which is in 3D,7 the linked documents appear on the sides when moving through the contents, or as Nelson puts it: “all objects sworfing (swooping and/or morphing) together” (Nelson 2016).Image source: Nelson (2016)A demonstration of sworfing is given by Nelson in the video below.8These implementations elucidate that creating multiple overlapping transclusions and content links results in complex (visual) information. Whereas Otlet’s experiments with paper cards are impractical in terms of implementation because of material constraints, the problem of mapping the interconnective structure in the digital realm has to do with how to visualize and interact with the resulting complex information. This has been a central concern for decades, as Conklin (1987) suggested in his analysis of hypertext systems in the 1980s. Referring to the image below, titled Tangled web of links, he writes:  This experimental implementation of a global map in the intermedia system shows the difficulty of providing users with spatial cues once a linked corpus contains more than a few dozen documents. This global map only represents about one tenth of the documents in a corpus[.] Conklin (1987)Image source: Conklin (1987)Nelson refers to it as the framing problem, to which he notes that “filtering links is a key aspect of front-end design [which] is a separate study in itself” (Nelson 1987).9Image source: Nelson (1987)3. InsightsDistilled from these examples, an interactive prototype of a digital document system (henceforth Nexae) will be developed based on the following conditions:  Documents are modular.  There must be multiple renditions.  Links are to be developed by distinguishing them according to types of connections.1. Documents are modular.The structure of ideas is multi-sequential, and knowledge is not fundamentally hierarchical. Knowledge is a process of decomposition and recomposition (analysis and synthesis). To realize the interconnective structure of documents and to facilitate the continuous process of decomposition and recomposition, Nexae will be developed based on the conception that documents are modular. Modularity implies the possibility for:  a link to point to an entire document or a particular content item within a document,  a content item existing in multiple documents,  overlapping links, and  the possibility for documents to be organized according to (and belong to) multiple categories.2. There must be multiple renditions.Significant to the design of the Encyclopédie is that there are multiple entry points through textual and visual renditions of its contents, which can be implemented as different view modes in the digital document system. The computer-generated diagram, elucidating the underlying network structure of connections within the Encyclopédie, is deemed particularly useful for gaining an infographic-like overview of the number of connections between documents belonging to different categories.There must be multiple renditions to convey different information about the interconnective structure, whether that be different representations of documents or arrangements, both hierarchical and non-hierarchical. Each view mode will be developed to offer different perspectives on documents at different levels of detail (e.g., view mode A at the document collection level, view mode B at the level of document selection, and view mode C at the level of content items).3. Links are to be developed by distinguishing them according to types of connections.Xanadu is a system with two link types: transclusions and content links. These two link types are based on distinguishing between arbitrary conceptual connections and those created when content is reused in another document. Importantly, unlike the convention of inserting reused content between quotation marks, transclusion also encompasses connections between content transiting different versions. For example, two drafts will have shared content items, and these are also transclusions. Transclusions enable content to be inserted from one document into another, keeping track and providing direct access to its original context, which relies on bidirectional links. The development of links will be based on distinguishing transclusions and non-transclusions. Adopting the concept of transcluding content means abandoning the concept of copying and pasting. Additionally, distinguishing links will involve exploring the visual form of links, how to indicate the link direction, and how to provide direct access to linked documents through interaction, whether by viewing documents side-by-side or some other means.The next entry involves the concept design of the digital document system.SourcesBorgman CL.

Boyd Rayward (2011) call “information chunks,” and what Ridi (2018) calls “information units.” In conventional terms, a paragraph, for example, is a content item; a quote within a paragraph is also a content item; a list and a list item are content items. &#8617;              One example is Otlet’s model, Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records, in which entities are linked on multiple levels in the form of a network (Borgman 2015). With this model, Otlet proposed to restructure the library catalog databases based on the conceptual structure of information resources. &#8617;              As stated in [Questions That Follow], the order of the book is the presentation and structure of text based on the form of books and defined by the format of manuscript and print. &#8617;              As acknowledged by Tim Berners-Lee, Xanadu influenced the development of the web (Ridi 2018). &#8617;              Traversing content on the web by selecting hyperlinks commonly entails blindly jumping and landing at the top of the page. Even if a sentence references a particular part of another webpage, a link cannot point directly to it.10 &#8617;              Note that the link direction is unclear, and the position and overlap of the windows are not convenient. &#8617;              One problem with this 3D version is that there is no obvious way of navigating the space. For reading and editing a document, it could be useful to snap into a full-frame view of a particular part of a document. &#8617;              The idea of viewing documents side-by-side is solid, but having documents fly in and out of view as you move through the document is not. There should be an interaction step in which the content is only opened through deliberate action. &#8617;              a problem to which this research project aims to propose a solution. &#8617;              It is possible to use anchor links that point to a specific section of a webpage, but it relies on the creator applying an HTML id attribute to the section title (see Stack Overflow). &#8617;      ",

As Ted Nelson (1987) explains, connections can be internal or external to a document, stated implicitly or explicitly. For example, phrases such as “in the example given below” or “as defined previously” establish <strong>implicit internal connections</strong>. <strong>Explicit internal connections</strong> are content items that, by convention, take the form of a footnote — the content of which can be a commentary on an idea, clarification of a term, parenthetical information, and suchlike. <strong>Explicit external connections</strong> are inclusions of one document segment into another (what Nelson (1980) coined transclusions) or some other direct connection by way of reference (paraphrased content with a citation, for example). Interconnection thus implies multiple potential structures other than the content-item-by-content-item sequence in a document (or, in conventional terms, the paragraph-by-paragraph sequence).</p><p>Other terms express similar notions about the various connections between documents. As Borgman (2015) writes, “[t]he body of relationships among documents is sometimes known as ‘<em>hypertextuality</em>.’” <em>Hypertext</em> is commonly associated with how it has been implemented on the web, understood in general terms as “a computer construct of links and data corresponding to files or parts of files that can be displayed in windows of various dimensions (Vandendorpe 2009).” Another term, used particularly within semiotics and literary theory, is <em>intertextuality</em> which describes abstract connections “as in the influence of one text on the meaning of another” (Borgman 2015). One such connection can be how one text is derived from a preceding text, as with Ulysses by James Joyce, which is a transformation of Odyssey by Homer (Vandendorpe 2009). In the definition of an <em>intertext</em> as it was first proposed, there is an emphasis on the perception of the reader, namely that the connections between one text and one that preceded or followed it results from the activity of reading (Vanderndorpe 2009). Ted Nelson (2015) calls it <em>intertwingularity</em> which “expresses a philosophical position about cross-connection,” namely that “all subjects and issues are intertwined and intermingled.”</p><p><em>Hypertextuality</em>, <em>intertextuality</em>, and <em>intertwingularity</em> coincide but not completely. These terms are similar yet different lenses (used within particular fields) to express the idea that</p><blockquote>  <p>documents do not stand alone, even if they look like independent objects. Rather, they are deeply connected to many other objects. (Borgman 2015)</p></blockquote><p><em>Interconnection</em> is a general term chosen and used to encompass these various connections between documents that ultimately result in complex layers of information. These connections can be established through reading and writing but also computational methods, such as applying natural language processing techniques for classifying text and keyword extraction.

One structure is the alphabetical structure, embedded as running heads throughout the volumes (seen in the image below), allowing access to content by keyword.</p><p><img src=\"assets/encyclopdie_vol01_internet_archives_AMA.png\" alt=\"\" /></p><p><em>Image source: <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/encyclopdieoud01alem/page/312/mode/2up\">Internet Archive</a></em></p><p>Other structures are the various diagrams, offering different renditions of the contents, such as the tree diagram from the first volume seen in the image below, functioning as a visual index.</p><p><img src=\"assets/encyclopdie_vol01_internet_archives_tree_map.png\" alt=\"\" /></p><p><em>Image source: <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/encyclopdieoud01alem/page/n69/mode/1up\">Internet Archive</a></em></p><p>These textual and diagrammatic ways of mapping structures are hierarchical, as was the convention at the time. However, as Rosenberg explains:</p><blockquote>  <p>Older encyclopedias were generally organized hierarchically and by subject. Theirs was designed to be navigated by keyword, to allow readers to enter and exit at any useful point. Additionally, their encyclopedia was hypertexted. Articles were linked in a web through a system of renvois or cross-references. The Encyclopédie also offered a hierarchical subject map, echoing the structure of older works, but, in the work of Diderot and d’Alembert, the tree of knowledge was presented as only one of several heuristics. (Rosenberg 2015)</p></blockquote><p>The other structure — the implementation of cross-references — is a system of internal connections linking articles together. Within this system, there are two types of internal connections. The first type of connection is recommendations for further reading on related subjects and topics, linking together, as Diderot put it, “…Dialectics to Metaphysics; Metaphysics to Theology; Theology to Jurisprudence; Jurisprudence to History; History to Geography and Chronology […]” (Curran 2019) and so on. The second type of connection “put contradictory articles into dialogue,” for example, the article <em>Freedom of Thought</em> is linked to Diderot’s article <em>Intolerance</em> (of the Christian Church), inviting the “reader to cultivate a critical viewpoint” (Curran 2019). As the computer-generated diagram (seen in the image below) further elucidates, implicit in the system of internal connections is an underlying network structure.</p><p><img src=\"assets/diderot_encyclopedie_map_crop.png\" alt=\"\" /></p><p><em>Diagram by Olsen and Blanchard (Image source: Rosenberg (2015))</em></p><p>Additionally, the diagram elucidates that conceiving knowledge as fundamentally hierarchical is not “paradigmatic of Enlightenment epistemology,” nor is it intrinsic to print (Rosenberg 2015). Rather, all subjects are interconnected, and as Rosenberg argues, though the</p><blockquote>  <p>network diagram would not have been familiar to the generation of the Encyclopedists, the concepts behind it were. They too were thinking about intellectual phenomena in terms of underlying structures and aggregate relationships. (Rosenberg 2015)</p></blockquote><h3 id=\"2--the-work-of-paul-otlet-1868-1944\">2  The work of Paul Otlet (1868-1944)</h3><p>The work of Paul Otlet — regarded as a pioneer of the field once called documentation that branched into what is now called information science (Le Deuff and Perret 2019) — developed new approaches to organizing and accessing information by devising models<sup id=\"fnref:otlet_model\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:otlet_model\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> and establishing theoretical principles of information. Otlet also explored how information organization might be in the future (once media other than the book would take precedence) in the form of metaphorical illustrations of a global network of documents (Heuvel and Rayward 2011).</p><p>Similar to the Encyclopédie — a project that is seen as in response to the eighteenth-century information overload (Rosenberg 2015) — Otlet’s work was in response to the nineteenth-century problem of “the enormous growth in the number of publications, specialist congresses, and international exhibitions” (Manfroid 2013). The problem that Otlet analyzed and explored solutions to was “how most effectively to create, maintain, and change institutional arrangements for collecting, storing, preserving, organizing, retrieving, and disseminating all of the recorded information that is — or will be — needed within society” (Rayward 1994). With that complex problem at hand, Otlet envisioned new approaches to storing, organizing, and disseminating information.</p><p>Otlet conceptualized documents as modular — made up of parts connected to other parts. An appropriate system, according to Otlet, must therefore allow and facilitate establishing links between these <em>parts</em> (i.e., content items). In designing such a system, Otlet explored the re-conceptualization of the Book as a global system of documents. As told by Heuvel and Rayward:</p><blockquote>  <p>In a 1911 lecture on the future of the book and of bibliography, Otlet came back to the idea he had first expressed in 1892 and in subsequent publications: ‘The arbitrary division into lines and pages of the book in its present format, does not at all correspond all with the presentation of ideas’ (p. 291). He envisioned the emergence of a future format of the book in which ‘each intellectual element, in corresponding to a physical element, will create a structure such that any combination of ideas, notions, and facts will be possible.’ He suggested that this process can operate in so mechanical a fashion that in the future, the book will truly become a machine to think with (Otlet in Heuvel and Rayward (2011))</p></blockquote><p>As the illustrations below suggest, for Otlet, the development of such a system entails <em>ripping</em> content items (representing ideas, notions, facts) from books and collecting each on separate paper cards.</p><p><img src=\"assets/the-book-in-connection-with-the-library-the-bibliographic-repertory-and-encyclopedia.png\" alt=\"\" /></p><p><em>Global Network of Universal Documentation (Image source: Heuvel and Rayward (2011))</em></p><p>The illustration below expresses a similar notion about how knowledge evolves.</p><p><img src=\"assets/otlet_raite_de_documentation.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p><p><em>Title and Source</em></p><p>%%find source%%</p><p>Otlet conceived knowledge as a process of decomposition and recomposition (analysis and synthesis). A document system must facilitate this continuous process by accommodating expansive growth and extensive reuse. One of his explorations includes a paper card-based system (seen in the image below) in which multiple links can be established to and from a card.</p><p><img src=\"assets/otlet_card_experiments.png\" alt=\"\" /></p><p><em>Multidimensional card system (Image source: Heuvel and Rayward (2011))</em></p><p>Connections between content items could be established through links and metadata. As Otlet writes:</p><blockquote>  <p>To increase the number of sides, one might well abandon the rectangular form of the card and adopt a polygonal form, an octagon for example. For sorting and systematically selecting the ideas that have been classified hierarchically, the cards are suspended from their centre. The Book as a structure of cards thus takes a quasi-circular form and can rotate. [I]ts structure […] constitutes a Book […] that has abandoned the traditional form of linear text arranged according to a unique plan. It has been transformed in some way into a body with several dimensions, as many dimensions as headings such that different searches using the same graphic elements on the cards are possible. (Otlet in Heuvel and Rayward (2011))</p></blockquote><p>As Heuvel and Rayward (2011) point out, the material manifestation of such a paper card system is “impractical for many reasons.” However, what Otlet describes is an open system in which many (types of) connections to and from the same content item (card) can be established through a link mechanism, forming an interconnective structure of documents. Beyond these experiments with paper cards, Otlet envisioned new visual representations of knowledge as a process of decomposition and recomposition. For example, as seen in the image below, “Otlet uses the architectural metaphor of the factory to visualize this process” (Heuvel 2017).</p><p><img src=\"assets/otlet_mundaneum.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p><p><em>Laboratorium Mundaneum (Image source: <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Laboratorium_Mundaneum.jpg\">Wikimedia Commons</a>)</em></p><p>Though the material constraints of paper-based technologies inhibited Otlet (e.g., books, paper cards, shelves, cabinets, and desks), he envisioned new ways of organizing and accessing information beyond what Adriaan van der Weel (2012) calls the <em>order of the book</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:order_of_the_book\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:order_of_the_book\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup></p><h3 id=\"3-the-original-hypertext-project-xanadu-by-ted-nelson-1937\">3 The original hypertext project Xanadu by Ted Nelson (1937)</h3><p>Nelson is most known for inventing the <em>back button</em>, and developing concepts such as <em>hypertext</em>, <em>virtuality</em>, and the <em>docuverse</em>. Hypertext is likely the most known but is merely one of the many concepts Nelson has spent decades developing within a larger project called Xanadu. Though Xanadu has never been fully implemented, the many prototypes and writings throughout the decades since the 1960s have had a profound impact on the evolution of hypertext.<sup id=\"fnref:xanadu_influence_web\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:xanadu_influence_web\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup></p><p>Xanadu is a hypertext system, a docuverse, technically a piece of software that, since its conception, has been designed to run on a global network of computers in which every document is to reside (Ridi 2018). Much akin to the work of Otlet, Xanadu is based on particular notions about how knowledge evolves and the structure of ideas. As Nelson writes:</p><blockquote>  <p>The physical universe is not all that decays. So do abstraction and categories. Human ideas, science, scholarship, and language constantly collapsing and unfolding. Any field, and the corpus of all fields, is a bundle of relationships subject to all kinds of twists, inversions, involutions, and rearrangements. (Nelson 1965)</p></blockquote><p>According to Nelson, too, it is this continuous process that a system must be designed to accommodate by having the capacity for new categorization systems and any arrangements of old and new content. Further, on the structure of thoughts and ideas, Nelson writes:</p><blockquote>  <p>[A]s you consider a thing, your thoughts crisscross it constantly, reviewing first one connection, then another. Each new idea is compared with many parts of the whole picture, or with some mental visualization of the whole picture itself. (Nelson 1987)</p></blockquote><p>In line with the notion that the structure of ideas is nonsequential, in his book Literary Machines (first published in 1980), Nelson defines <em>hypertext</em> as “nonsequential writing—text that branches and allows choices to the reader” (Nelson 1987). Whereas writing and structuring sequential text entails choosing “one expository sequence from among the possible myriad,” writing nonsequential text entails deciding on the “interconnective structure” — “where to put things in the searchable maze” (Nelson 1987). It is based on these definitions and notions about how ideas and knowledge evolve that Nelson envisioned Xanadu.</p><p>Xanadu has gone through many revisions and different prototype implementations over six decades, but the core concepts have remained fundamentally the same. In what follows, those concepts are examined with reflections on some of the implementations and juxtaposed to how those concepts are implemented on the web.</p><p><strong>Integrated History Management</strong></p><p>Xanadu is a system that stores (and makes accessible) every change made to documents, integrated in such a way that former states can be retrieved and reworked (Nelson 1987). As seen in the image below, people can choose whether those changes are local/private or online/public.</p><p><img src=\"assets/nelson_public_private.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Image source: Nelson (1987)</em></p><p>Once a document is online/public, any changes made (e.g., if the writer revises the content, or readers reuse parts of a document or create links to/from a document) are stored; effectively, the history of every document is accessible to anyone. This would be the same if the web were built with an integrated history management system such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git\">Git</a>, not as an optional tool but as a core feature.</p><p><strong>Bidirectional Visual Links</strong></p><p>The multidimensional structure of Xanadu is designed for two main types of connections between documents, expressed by the two link types <em>content links</em> and <em>transclusions</em>. All links are implemented as bidirectional visual links. Content links are the arbitrary connections people (writers and readers) create as they engage with text, and <em>transclusions</em> are reused content items. By convention, transclusions are what are known as excerpts and typographically distinguished as block quotes or inline quotes, and the link between the <em>copied</em> and the <em>pasted</em> is usually embedded as a citation. However, as Nelson writes:</p><blockquote>  <p>Transclusion is what quotation, copying and cross-referencing merely attempt: they are ways that people have had to <em>imitate</em> transclusion, which is the true abstract relationship that paper cannot show. (Nelson 1999)</p></blockquote><p>Content items are not duplicated; rather, <em>transcluded</em> — included in a document with a visual link to the original document. Since all links are bidirectional, every outward and inward-pointing link is accessible, which means the original document also points to documents that reuse parts of its contents. Transclusions offer a way to retrieve “the origins and context of quotations, excerpts and anthologized materials, and content transiting between versions” (Nelson 1999).</p><p>On a technical level, links are not embedded but implemented as an overlay, much akin to “a cache, or an alias on the desktop” (Nelson 1999), enabling multiple overlapping links to the same (part of a) document. Additionally, because all changes are stored, even if the original document undergoes changes, it is always possible to view the content item in its original context at the time it was transcluded.</p><p>In contrast, links on the web are embedded (in HTML) and only point outward. When a website is cited as a source in a text, it usually indicates the date the website was accessed. However, if the contents of the website have been deleted or changed since then, there is no way of accessing previous versions. Additionally, on the web, it is only possible to establish links at the document level (or <em>page</em> level)<sup id=\"fnref:links_on_the_web\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:links_on_the_web\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> whereas, in Xanadu, link endpoints are at the level of the content item. As for how this would look and work, Nelson envisioned Xanadu as a system in which documents are viewed side-by-side with visual links, expressed by two concepts: <em>parallel documents</em> and <em>transpointing windows</em> (Nelson 1999).</p><p><img src=\"assets/hypernotes01.png\" alt=\"\" />An improvement would be landing at the particular linked part of a document:<img src=\"assets/hypernotes03.png\" alt=\"\" /></p><p><strong>Side-By-Side Documents With Visual Links</strong></p><p>Parallel documents, according to Nelson:</p><blockquote>  <p>are everywhere, but are not generally acknowledged. There are relatively few explicitly parallel documents (like Tom Stoppard’s play “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead”, which is explicitly parallel to “Hamlet” – showing events that occur offstage in “Hamlet” and vice versa). But implicitly parallel documents are everywhere – the parallelism of commentaries, the parallelism of long and short versions of reports, the parallelism of translations, the parallelism of holy books. (Nelson 1998)</p></blockquote><p>Thus documents should be viewed side-by-side with <em>transpointing windows</em> to:</p><blockquote>  <p>support analysis and detailed understanding – by parallel commentary, precise annotation and the explication of contents; by the facilitation of pinpoint controversy. These are needed not just in scholarship, but legislation, diplomacy, and anywhere that interrelated documents need to be seen[…for] detailed explication, commentary or disagreement[, and for] comparing successive versions of a document. (Nelson 1999)</p></blockquote><p>A prototype from 2003, in which the links are solid lines pointing to and from content items within windows, is seen in the image below.<sup id=\"fnref:2003_prototype\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2003_prototype\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup></p><p><img src=\"assets/nelson_cosmicbook.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Image source: Nelson (2015)</em></p><p>In another prototype, the links are applied not as solid lines but as color-coded highlights. Additionally, the main document is in the middle, and the linked documents are on the left and right sides with a smaller font size.</p><p><img src=\"assets/xanadoc.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Screenshot of Xanadoc (try the interactive demo <a href=\"https://xanadu.com/xanademos/MoeJusteOrigins.html\">here</a>)</em></p><p>In the latest Xanadu prototype, which is in 3D,<sup id=\"fnref:3D_prototype\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3D_prototype\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup> the linked documents appear on the sides when moving through the contents, or as Nelson puts it: “all objects sworfing (swooping and/or morphing) together” (Nelson 2016).</p><p><img src=\"assets/nelson_click_full_frame.png\" alt=\"\" /></p><p><img src=\"assets/xanaduspace_2007.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Image source: Nelson (2016)</em></p><p>A demonstration of <em>sworfing</em> is given by Nelson in the video below.<sup id=\"fnref:sworfing\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:sworfing\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup></p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1yLNGUeHapA?start=274\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><p>These implementations elucidate that creating multiple overlapping <em>transclusions</em> and <em>content links</em> results in complex (visual) information. Whereas Otlet’s experiments with paper cards are impractical in terms of implementation because of material constraints, the problem of mapping the interconnective structure in the digital realm has to do with how to visualize and interact with the resulting complex information. This has been a central concern for decades, as Conklin (1987) suggested in his analysis of hypertext systems in the 1980s. Referring to the image below, titled <em>Tangled web of links</em>, he writes:</p><blockquote>  <p>This experimental implementation of a global map in the intermedia system shows the difficulty of providing users with spatial cues once a linked corpus contains more than a few dozen documents. This global map only represents about one tenth of the documents in a corpus[.] Conklin (1987)</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"assets/conklin_fig11.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Image source: Conklin (1987)</em></p><p>Nelson refers to it as the <em>framing problem</em>, to which he notes that “filtering links is a key aspect of front-end design [which] is a separate study in itself” (Nelson 1987).<sup id=\"fnref:front-end-design\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:front-end-design\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup></p><p><img src=\"assets/nelson_framing_problem.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Image source: Nelson (1987)</em></p><h2 id=\"3-insights\">3. Insights</h2><p>Distilled from these examples, an interactive prototype of a digital document system (henceforth Nexae) will be developed based on the following conditions:</p><ol>  <li>Documents are modular.</li>  <li>There must be multiple renditions.</li>  <li>Links are to be developed by distinguishing them according to types of connections.</li></ol><h3 id=\"1-documents-are-modular\">1.

Knowledge is a process of decomposition and recomposition (analysis and synthesis). To realize the interconnective structure of documents and to facilitate the continuous process of decomposition and recomposition, Nexae will be developed based on the conception that documents are modular. Modularity implies the possibility for:</p><ul>  <li>a link to point to an entire document or a particular content item within a document,</li>  <li>a content item existing in multiple documents,</li>  <li>overlapping links, and</li>  <li>the possibility for documents to be organized according to (and belong to) multiple categories.</li></ul><h3 id=\"2-there-must-be-multiple-renditions\">2. There must be multiple renditions.</h3><p>Significant to the design of the Encyclopédie is that there are multiple entry points through textual and visual renditions of its contents, which can be implemented as different view modes in the digital document system. The computer-generated diagram, elucidating the underlying network structure of connections within the Encyclopédie, is deemed particularly useful for gaining an infographic-like overview of the number of connections between documents belonging to different categories.</p><p>There must be multiple renditions to convey different information about the interconnective structure, whether that be different representations of documents or arrangements, both hierarchical and non-hierarchical. Each view mode will be developed to offer different perspectives on documents at different levels of detail (e.g., view mode A at the document collection level, view mode B at the level of document selection, and view mode C at the level of content items).</p><h3 id=\"3-links-are-to-be-developed-by-distinguishing-them-according-to-types-of-connections\">3. Links are to be developed by distinguishing them according to types of connections.</h3><p>Xanadu is a system with two link types: transclusions and content links. These two link types are based on distinguishing between arbitrary conceptual connections and those created when content is reused in another document. Importantly, unlike the convention of inserting reused content between quotation marks, transclusion also encompasses connections between content transiting different versions. For example, two drafts will have shared content items, and these are also transclusions. Transclusions enable content to be inserted from one document into another, keeping track and providing direct access to its original context, which relies on bidirectional links. The development of links will be based on distinguishing transclusions and non-transclusions. Adopting the concept of transcluding content means abandoning the concept of <em>copying</em> and <em>pasting</em>. Additionally, distinguishing links will involve exploring the visual form of links, how to indicate the link direction, and how to provide direct access to linked documents through interaction, whether by viewing documents side-by-side or some other means.</p><p>The <a href=\"04\">next entry</a> involves the concept design of the digital document system.</p><h2 id=\"sources\">Sources</h2><p>Borgman CL.

What are those concepts and conventions and the inherited biases and constraints derived from paper documents?  Why use the phrase digital realm?  What is meant by digital document?  What are the distinct properties of digital documents and paper documents?  What does it mean to map and access the interconnective structure of documents?  What is the interconnective structure of documents?1. What is the docuverse?The docuverse — as in universe of documents — is a term coined by Ted Nelson that describes a universal library system on networked computers. As Nelson writes in Literary Machines:  All of storage near and far must therefore become a united whole— what is now called a “distributed database.” […] The documents and their links unite into what is essentially a swirling complex of equi-accessible unity, a single great universal text and data grid, or, as we call it, the docuverse (Nelson 1987).In other words, the docuverse is a construct in which documents reside, understood as a metadocument with all the information about the (changes made to the) content, links, and metadata of all documents. Nelson’s vision of the docuverse, Xanadu, is examined in the next entry.2. What is meant by paper document?A paper document primarily contains the modality text, and the medium1 used for its transmission is paper, meaning it encompasses the manuscript and print traditions.3. What are those conventions and concepts and the inherited biases and constraints derived from paper documents?Conventions particular to paper documents are derived from what Adriaan van der Weel (2012) calls the Order of the Book — presentation and structure of text based on the form of books and defined by the format of manuscript and print. Engaging with paper documents thus requires familiarity with concepts such as a table of contents, chapters, running head, page numbers, citations, reference lists, appendices, and how they are used as parts of a system. Beyond those pertaining specifically to the paper page are concepts derived from the environments in which people engage with paper documents. Examples are the clipboard, paper bin, folders, files, desktop and activities such as cutting, pasting, highlighting and paging — transferred to the digital realm as metaphorical concepts. These are some of the conventions and concepts derived from paper documents.Inherited biases and constraints can be seen in the conception of digital documents as files organized into nested folders. How the file system (a paper document management system) has been transferred into the digital realm is grounded in the assumption that all files are independent objects that fit neatly into a hierarchical structure. Even if a file conceptually belongs to multiple categories, it can only exist in one. If it is insisted upon that a file belongs to more than one category, then just as with a paper file, that digital file must be copied to the clipboard and pasted into another folder, and we now have two separate copies.2Concepts and conventions derived from paper documents have been transferred to the digital realm, inheriting the biases and constraints. It begins at the computer operating system level but permeates the digital realm.4. Why use the phrase digital realm?%%Land in land of paper is used to emphasize how documents that take the material form of paper are bound to physical reality. What is possible with text or images or symbols in the land of paper is constrained by what is physically possible.%%Realm in digital realm is used to emphasize that it is a constructed space. The digital realm is a space in which any conceivable construct can exist, made up of any sets of concepts that take any conceivable shape and behave and interact in any conceivable way. If, for example, the file system is not convenient for organizing documents, then such a system can and should be re-conceived.5. What is meant by digital document?Documents that pertain to the digital realm. A digital document primarily contains the modality text, and the medium used for its transmission is digital computers.6. What are the distinct properties of digital documents and paper documents?Whereas a paper document primarily contains text and images and other graphic elements, a digital document can also contain video, sound, and other interactive elements. Operating under the premise (substantiated below) that the medium used for the transmission of text yields particular constraints and capacities, two distinct properties are relevant to the juxtaposition of paper documents and digital documents:  Text on the paper page is inscribed and static; text in the digital realm is encoded and dynamic (Weel 2012).  With text on the paper page, actions are direct; with text in the digital realm, actions are interactive.1. Text on the paper page is inscribed and static; text in the digital realm is encoded and dynamic.With text on the paper page, language takes a static material form. From a historical perspective, the materialization of language significantly impacted human cognition. In The Mind on Paper: Reading, Consciousness and Rationality, developmental psychologist David Olson (2017) gives an analysis incorporating a historical account of the relationship between literacy and forms of thought. By his account, engaging and working with paper documents engendered critical thinking and systematic knowledge (Olson 2017). Similar claims are made by Eric Havelock (1976), who in Origins of Western Literacy establishes an integral relationship between the technology of writing and rational and analytic thought. And on the study of reading and its impact on cognition, as Neil Postman (1986) points out, it has been concluded by most scholars “that the sequential, propositional character of the written word fosters what Walter Ong calls the ‘analytic management of knowledge.’”That is not to suggest that analytic thought and rationality were not possible prior to written language, but to engage with text is “to follow a line of thought, which requires considerable powers of classifying, inference-making and reasoning” and requires mapping ideas, comparing assertions, “connect[ing] one generalization to another” (Postman 1986). For example, from research within the learning sciences, Roy Pea (1985) discusses the form of arguments, contrasting oral and written language, and its impact on logical analysis. With text on the paper page, human memory capacities were extended, allowing an argument to be stored and directly available to the reader/writer to evaluate the relationship between its parts for consistency and locate potential contradictions. With the advent of print technology, in particular, there was a greater capacity for “precision in the transmission of detail,” leading to a “much greater exactness in the representation of knowledge […] through the use of such typically typographic aids as tables and different typefaces, font sizes, and white space as a means of ordering information” (Weel 2012).  Uniformity, predictability, consistency, and standardization were prerequisites for analytical and scientific thinking. (Weel 2012)These effects on human cognition are related to the staticity of (and what it entails to engage with) text on the paper page.3 In contrast to text on the paper page, digital text is marked by dynamicity and modifiability. At a basic level, digital text is encoded as a bit pattern (e.g., 1010111) representing a character unit (e.g., W). As Stéfan Sinclair and Geoffrey Rockwell (2016) suggest, these properties imply the potential for rearrangement and restructuring (i.e., move these bits here to there, extract only those bits, rearrange them according to this, then that, and put those here). At yet another level, digital text is encoded through a markup language. Encoding text involves “marking up” the structure, the visual presentation, and the metadata—all of which can be utilized to modify (the form, content, and meaning of) texts. For example, a content item that is a title in one document can be transformed into a list item in the same or another document (e.g., an expandable table of contents). Importantly, modification of digital text by modifying the code that transcribes it can be done without repercussions to source content. That is, rearranging parts, transforming between formats, extracting and sorting text segments, and annotating or performing analyses on those extracted text segments involves operations that can be performed without repercussions to the source content. With paper documents, such actions are enacted directly upon the material.2. With text on the paper page, actions are direct; with text in the digital realm, actions are interactive.Any action is direct when engaging with text on the paper page. Actions such as writing, underlining, erasing, cutting out, pasting in, folding, stacking, sorting, and resorting, are in a direct relationship between the action, the operations involved in that action, and the perception of that action. In the digital realm, a command — a keystroke, a tap on a touchscreen, a verbal utterance — can equate near-infinite set of (opaque) operations. For example, selecting a particular interactive element through a mouse click can result in an instantaneous rearrangement and transformation of the shape of documents, which can be reversed by selecting another interactive element. Given these distinctive properties, text in the digital realm invites modification of its parts in ways that are infeasible with text on the paper page. This project aims to explore the potential of these properties.7. What does it mean to map and access the interconnective structure of documents?To map is the activity of establishing connections by creating links or attaching metadata to documents. Mapping connections can be done by the reader and writer of a document. To access is used to encompass retrieving, bringing into view, filtering, arranging, and traversing documents based on those connections in a visually coherent way.8. What is the interconnective structure of documents?The concept of interconnection is elaborated on in the next entry.SourcesHavelock EA. Origins of Western Literacy.

QuestionWhat may result from undermining the biases and conventions inherited from paper documents when creating a construct for digital documents based on accommodating interconnection?In creating a docuverse, what may result from reworking (and taking new approaches to represent and interacting with) concepts derived from prominent examples of systems that accommodate interconnection?What may result from reworking (and taking new approaches to representing and interacting with) concepts for mapping and accessing multiple structures of documents to create a digital construct?Can new approaches be taken to representational and interactive concepts for mapping and accessing the interconnective structure of documents, and what are the consequences?What new approaches can be taken to representational concepts for mapping and accessing the interconnective structure of documents to enable new ways of traversing documents through interaction, and what are the consequences?3. HypothesisDocuments can be seen as containers of content items (representing ideas, theories, facts, beliefs, and so on). By creating different types of connections among content items, an interconnective structure can be formed. Types of connections can be implicit or explicit and external or internal. It is contended that the way concepts and conventions derived from paper documents have been transferred to the digital realm constrains the potential for mapping and accessing that interconnective structure.The properties of a medium yield particular capacities and constraints to what (and how a) modality is transmitted. Bound by the material properties of paper, conventions developed for mapping interconnective structures in the ages of manuscript and print entailed embedding information in the form of concepts such as footnotes (explicit internal connections) and citations (explicit external connections). The convention of embedding (the type of) information (that is considered additional to the type that is considered the main sequence) has been transferred from paper documents to digital documents, inheriting its biases and constraints. For example, the graphical implementation of footnotes suggests a hierarchical relationship between the content item to which the footnote is attached and the content item in the footnote. Further, the convention for how footnotes are applied dictates that it is not possible to map multiple connections to the same content item.A system for digital documents — having different properties than paper documents — can be created without those constraints and have the capacity for realizing the interconnective structure of documents. Mapping the interconnective structure of documents will ultimately result in complex layers of information. A digital document system can offer ways to (re)arrange, (un)group, and show/hide documents and links through interaction, beyond what is possible with paper documents.4. MethodThe method is based on an iterative process of content creation, concept design, and creating interactive prototypes of a digital document system.Step 1: Content CreationThe first step involves creating content on the topic of interconnection and related terms and concepts, which will serve as sample content in the final prototype. Those terms and concepts will be derived by examining prominent document systems considered influential in the evolution of information technologies. The purpose is to gather insight into which features of those systems can be utilized for step 2.Step 2: Concept DesignThis is the blueprint step. It entails working out and creating sketches of the concepts comprised by the digital document system.Step 3: Interactive PrototypesThis step involves creating interactive prototypes of the current state of the concept design and the content created as sample content. The purpose is to determine what aspects work as intended and which need refining.Questions include how to design interactions for switching view modes or how different categories of information are visually distinguished. For example, if footnotes are abandoned, then what concept will allow mapping the type of content that is conventionally inserted as footnotes?The interactive prototypes created in this step are expected to inform modifications to the design. As each informs the other, steps 2-3 are iterated until it is surmised that enough has been gathered for step 4.Step 4: ImplementationThis step involves completing the content and the design by making improvements based on what has been gathered in the previous steps. Within the bounds of feasibility, the final prototype will allow people to access the interconnective structure of documents by switching view modes (to gain different perspectives) and traversing documents containing the sample content.5. DocumentationFor each iteration of steps 2-3, the resulting interactive prototypes are published in this weblog. Each entry contains the current state of the content created and the design of the digital document system (i.e., the interactive prototypes described in step 3). Reflections will be written at different stages of the process, serving to inform modifications for improvement. The final prototype will be developed in prototyping software and published online.The next entry elaborates on the terms used in this entry.",

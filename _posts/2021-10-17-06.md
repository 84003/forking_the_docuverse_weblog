## Inventory, Vertical, and Lateral View

While in Inventory View, selecting a node opens a document. Selecting another node will close the already-open document and open the other. This is similar to how clicking a bookmarked url in a web browser opens a page, if another bookmarked url is clicked, it replaces that page. It is also possible to open a new tab, but the difference here is that the documents are opened on the same plane and the links are visualized.

In the image above the linked documents are always visible and join in the middle of the open document. The image below shows an alternate version in which the linked documents are only visible when hovering on a specific link in the open document. In both versions, if a link is selected from within an open document, the linked document opens and the content items align in Lateral View.

Lateral View (taken from what is called the lateral reading method) enables checking the original context of a transcluded content item. Through tag links it is possible to sort which link types are to be displayed. This means it is also possible to travel by a link-path.

Below is a video demonstration of switching between Inventory View to Lateral View.

<!-- The visual appearance will only be the default. In other words, it should be modifiable. Similar to other text editors that allow people to change or make their own theme by editing the css, that should also be possible here. -->

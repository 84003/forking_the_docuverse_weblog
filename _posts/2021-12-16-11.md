This entry showcases an interactive prototype allowing navigation in Inventory View and Lateral Mode.

## Interactive Prototype

<iframe style="border: 2px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)" width="640" height="480" src="https://framer.com/embed/Round-04--dHgNWv9LinqxHeYEk1er/F_MbbVHe7?highlights=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Reflection

- To indicate multiple *ghost*-instances of the same document, the title underline is deemed too subtle.
	- Color-coded borders might be better suited.
	- The color-coded borders should also appear upon hovering a document in Inventory View for coherency.

## Improvements Due

- Apply color-coded borders
- While in Lateral Mode, create a frame showing an overview of the current location in Inventory View.
- Apply sequence-links at the top and bottom of open documents.
- Visually distinguish link direction.
- Improve visualization of link endpoints.

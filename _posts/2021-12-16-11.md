This entry showcases an interactive prototype allowing navigation in Inventory View and Lateral Mode.

## Interactive Prototype

<iframe style="border: 2px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)" width="640" height="480" src="https://framer.com/embed/Round-04--dHgNWv9LinqxHeYEk1er/F_MbbVHe7?highlights=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Reflection

- For the purpose of indicating multiple instances of the same document, the title underline is deemed too subtle.
	- Color-coded borders might be better suited.
	- For coherency, the color-coded borders should also appear upon hovering a document in Inventory View.

## Improvements Due

- In Lateral Mode:
  - While hovering a preview should bring that preview to front.
  - While hovering linked text (or preview) should result in active color linked text.
- Enable the filter menu
- Visualization of multiple links to/from the same content item.
- While in Lateral Mode there should be a frame in the bottom corner providing an overview of the current location in Inventory View.

## Interactive Prototype

## Things To Fix

- In Lateral Mode:
  - While hovering a preview should bring that preview to front.
  - While hovering linked text (or preview) should result in active color linked text.
- Enable the filter menu
- Visualization of multiple links to/from the same content item.
- Step-by-step tutorial pop-ups as an introduction before entering the docuverse.

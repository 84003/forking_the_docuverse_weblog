title: "Concept Design and Prototype: Representing Linked Documents as Aliases"
number: "10"
tags:
---

Alterations and additions:
- Lateral Mode renamed Lateral View
- Redesign of Lateral View
	- The preview icons (seen in a [previous entry](08)) are now aliases positioned on the sides of the open document.
	- Only one document can be open, positioned in the middle.

In this entry, one document is the main document, and its linked documents are represented as aliases.

## Opening Documents

**Inventory View**

The image below shows how to open a document in Inventory View to enter Lateral View.

**Lateral View**

While in Lateral View, it is possible to open the linked documents. Note that each linked content item can be of the same document, in which case there are multiple aliases of the same document (in the example below, document 1).

## Aliases

The aliases display the particular linked content item (i.e., inactive) on the side of the open document. In the example below, there are two tag links and one transclusion.

Upon hovering on a link, the alias comes into view (i.e., active) together with the \#Label of the tag link.

## Interactive Prototype

The interactive prototypes below explore how to indicate active and inactive states and how to animate multiple aliases of the same document.

### Active/Inactive Aliases

Two versions of aliases are shown below.

**Opacity Version**

### Animating Multiple Aliases of the Same Document

If the open document has several links to the same document, then that document has multiple aliases. In the first image below, the multiple aliases appear before a document is open, and in the second image, aliases appear after the middle document is open.

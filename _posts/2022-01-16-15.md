Alterations and additions:
- Redesign of links to distinguish:
	- Link direction.
	- Link endpoint (by improving the design of the brackets).
- Added a legend (a list of the icons and symbols).
- Color coding:
	- Title underline is replaced by border color.

## Visual Distinction of Links: Link Type, Link Direction, Link Endpoint

**Link types**: *Transclusion*, *seqlink*, and *taglink*.

**Link direction**: To or from a document and another.

**Link endpoints**: Distinguishing between a link that points to an entire document and a link that points to a particular part of a document.

Examples of different link types, directions, and endpoints are seen in the image below.

Links are visualized as a single element separate from the label.

The image below shows what it would look like if multiple labels were attached to a taglink.

## Improvements Due

- Color-coding needs improvement.
	- As noted in the [previous entry](14), there are only so many distinct colors. A two-color system can be applied. One active color for the open document and an inactive color for the aliases.

The [next entry](16) explores the implementation of these alterations in the concept design.

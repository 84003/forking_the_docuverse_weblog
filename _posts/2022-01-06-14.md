Alterations and additions:
- Redesign of links to distinguish:
	- Link direction
	- Link endpoint (by improving the design of the brackets)
- Added a legend (a list of the icons and symbols).
- Color coding:
	- Title underline is replaced with border color.
- Added a location frame (showing Inventory View) while in Lateral View.
- Aliases no longer have expand icons but use brightness to indicate that it can be triggered to open the linked document.
- Minimize icon is replaced by a node-link icon, triggering the movement from Lateral View to Inventory View.

## Visual Distinction of Links: Link Type, Link Direction, Link Endpoint

**Link types**: *Transclusion*, *sequence link*, and *tag link*.

**Link direction**: To or from one document and another.

**Link endpoints**: Distinguishing between a link that points to an entire document and a link that points to a particular part of a document.

Examples of different link types, directions, and endpoints are seen in the image below.

Links are visualized as a single element separate from the label.

The image below shows what it would look like if multiple labels were attached to a tag link.

## Switching View Modes

The expand icon is replaced with a node-link icon, which triggers the movement from Lateral View to Inventory View.

## Traversing Documents in Lateral View Using the Location Frame

## Redesign of Aliases

The expand icons are removed, and now the brightness and change of cursor indicate that clicking an alias will open the linked document. The addition of an ellipsis indicates that the aliases only reveal part of the linked document.

## Interactive Prototype

Traverse documents in the interactive prototype below.

## Improvements Due

- In Lateral View:
  - Hovering a preview should bring that preview to the front.
  - Hovering linked text (or preview) should result in active-color linked text.
  - Visualization of multiple links to/from the same content item.
- Filter menu
- Color-coding needs improvement.
	- As noted in the [previous entry](13), there are only so many distinct colors. A two-color system can be applied. One active color for the open document and an inactive color for the aliases (displayed in the location frame as well).

## Discarded Attempts

### Location Frame Transitions

### Visual Distinction of Links

**Position and Alignment**

In the image below, in addition to the left-bracket link, the title, the link, the label, and the linked text are aligned to emphasize that it points from the entire document on the left to a particular part in the document on the right.

In the image below, the label is placed close to the linked text within the open document.

Alterations and additions:
- Metadata of documents accessible through the ellipsis icon.
- Title underline is chosen over border color.

This entry is a continuation of [entry 11](11), showcasing an interactive prototype allowing traversing documents in Inventory View and Lateral View.

## Interactive Prototype

<iframe style="border: 2px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)" width="640" height="480" src="https://framer.com/embed/Round-04--dHgNWv9LinqxHeYEk1er/F_MbbVHe7?highlights=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Reflection

- The title underline is deemed too subtle to indicate multiple aliases of the same document.
	- Color-coded borders might be better suited.[^color_code_problem]
	- The color-coded borders should also appear upon hovering a document in Inventory View for coherency.

[^color_code_problem]: ...though once there are more documents, there will be too many indistinguishable colors.

## Improvements Due

- Apply color-coded borders.
- While in Lateral View, create a frame showing an overview of the current location in Inventory View.
- Apply *seqlinks* at the top and bottom of open documents.
- Visually distinguish link direction.
- Improve visualization of link endpoints.

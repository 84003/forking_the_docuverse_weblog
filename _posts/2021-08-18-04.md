View modes are different levels of perspective on documents. In addition, each view mode differs in the components used to represent a document.

1. **Inventory View**
	- At the level of the collection.
	- Documents are represented as nodes, connections as links in a two-dimensional diagram.
	- Displays the number of connections between documents.
2. **Stack View**
	- At the level of a selection of the collection.
	- Documents are represented as layers, connections as links in a three-dimensional stack.
	- Displays selection of connections (link type subcategories).
3. **Merge View**
	- At the level of content items.
	- A document is represented as a single frame (full screen).
	- Displays connections side-by-side or top-to-bottom.

## 1. Inventory View

In this view mode, the entire inventory is visible and represented as a diagram in which a **node** denotes a document and a **link** denotes connections of various types (specified below).

**Node**

The size of a node reflects the number of content items it contains (i.e., the size of the document).

**Link**

The thickness of a link reflects the number of links between documents.

In Inventory View, it is possible to select nodes to create a stack for entering Stack View, as seen in the image above.

## 2. Stack View

A **stack** comprises a set of documents represented as **layers** that contain **content items**.

**Stack**

A stack can be thought of as a workspace. The inventory in its entirety may contain complex layers of information, so creating stacks is a convenient method for engaging with complexity by selecting those to view in more detail.

**Layer**

A document is represented as a layer, which instead of having a single title, has a tag. In the image below, there are four layers: `#MAIN,` `#A,` `#B,` and `#C.`

**Content Item**

Content items are the parts that make up a text. A content item can have any number of tags, placing it in multiple layers.

**Link Types**

In the image below, there are several links between the layers. As defined in the [previous entry](3), there are two main categories of connections that cross the boundaries of documents: those that are transclusions (reused content items; inclusions of one document segment into another), and those that are not transclusions. In the image below, these two types are visually distinguished by dot-line-dot links and side-surface links.

&#10033; These two link types must be visually distinguished, but the visual form is subject to change.

The links that are not transclusions are categorized according to whichever taxonomy people wish to develop within the construct, hence the appropriation of the common usage of a hashtag as a metadata tag. For example, in the image below, if content item `ID_P2` is a comment on content item `ID_P1`, then the layer could be tagged `#COMMENTS.` If the other two layers are different references, these layers could be tagged `#REFERENCE_X` and `#REFERENCE_Y.`

It is also possible to display links only between a selection of layers in the stack. Upon selection, the stack is rearranged. The layers `#MAIN` and `#COMMENTS` are selected in the two images below, displaying the links between them, followed by stack rearrangement.

While in Stack View, it is possible to merge all or a selection of layers. The arrangement of the stack will determine how the layers are merged.

## 3. Merge View

`#MAIN` and `#COMMENTS` are merged side by side in the image below.

Only the linked content items (between `#MAIN` and `#COMMENTS`) are displayed side by side in the image below.

The image below shows the option for merging the content items sequentially. If another layer were included, the order would depend on the arrangement of layers in Stack View.

The attempt here is to finalize the design of the visual elements in Lateral Mode. The main design challenges involve the color-coding and how cursor events change the display states of different categories of information.

## Color-Coding of Multiple Instances of the Same Document

In designing Lateral Mode, one of the challenges is how to indicate multiple instances of the same document. In the image above linked content items share the same color. In another version, a color-coded border around the previews is implemented, as seen in the image below.

 A more subtle approach is taken in the second image below, having a color-coded title underline. Additionally, all linked content items are purple while navigation icons remain gray, which makes them two distinct categories of information.

The document previews on the side are meant to be less visually prominent than the open document in the middle. To that end, the title underline is more appropriate.

## The Position and Visual Implementation of Taglink Labels

A second challenge is (beyond visually distinguishing link types) visually indicating (1) the link direction and (2) whether the link points to a particular content item within a document or the entire document.

In the examples below, the taglink points from a particular content item of the open document (middle) to the entire preview document (left). Specifically, the word *modality* is linked to the entire document called *Defining Modality and Medium*. The direction of the taglink is visually indicated by the label *Definition*. The three images below show variations of the position of the label. The third image is deemed optimal because the visual information is separated into two categories and two cursor events.

In the above below, whether the link points to a particular content item within a document or the entire document is shown **while not hovering**, and **while hovering** additionally shows the link direction and the label.

In the image above, all information categories are visible **while not hovering**.

In the image above, **while not hovering** shows whether the link points to a particular content item within a document or the entire document, and **while hovering** hides the previous information and shows the link direction and the label.

### Redesign of the Location Frame

In the previous version of the location frame, traversing documents meant that movement was animated both in the main frame and the location frame.

In this version, all documents are displayed in the location frame and the movement is animated through change in link color and node brightness.

The brightest document is the one that is active (i.e., open), and the purple links indicate the inactive (linked documents).

### Transition Animations: Spawning Alias Documents

The animation of the links now split into separate links as multiple aliases spawn.

### Addition of a Legend

The legend provides information about the various link types, which is accessible through the info icon in the bottom left corner.

### Addition of a Metadata Window

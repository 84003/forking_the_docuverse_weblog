This entry discusses points for improving the design presented in the [previous entry](04).

## To Engage With Complexity

The purpose of Stack View is to enable the (re)arrangement of a selection of documents in a particular order for entering Merge View. Creating *stacks* is supposed to be a convenient method for engaging with complexity by selecting which to view in more detail. Shifting from a 2D to a 3D perspective may obfuscate and not serve that purpose well.[^filtering_technique]

[^filtering_technique]: A filtering technique might be a better solution, which requires a grouping mechanism (explored in [entry 08](8)).

In abandoning Stack View, proceeding first requires defining the basic concepts more clearly. Questions are:
- What constitutes a document?
- How are links attached?
- What link types?

These questions are explored in the [next entry](06).

This entry discusses points for improving the design presented in the [previous entry](4), particularly Stack View.

## Engaging With Complexity

The purpose of Stack View is to enable the arrangement of a set of selected documents in a particular order for entering Merge View. Creating stacks is supposed to be a convenient method for engaging with complexity by selecting which to view in more detail. However, shifting from a 2D to a 3D perspective may obfuscate and not serve that purpose well. A filtering technique might be a better solution (explored in a [following entry](8)). In abandoning Stack View, proceeding first requires definitions of the basic concepts, how these concepts become components, and then how these components interact.

Questions are:
- What constitutes a document in the construct?
- How are links attached, and how do they operate?

Improvements due:
- Labels should also be attached to links.

See [next entry](06).

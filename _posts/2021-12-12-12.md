In designing Lateral View, one of the challenges is indicating that there are multiple aliases of the same document. Below are variations of applying a color code.

**Verison 1**

In version 1, linked content items share the same color.

In the top-left corner in the image above, the blue color-coding and shape of the link indicate that the word "modality" in the middle document is linked to the entire side document. In the bottom-right of the image, the green color coding and shape of the link indicate that only parts of each document are linked.[^version_1]

[^version_1]: Having multiple colors throughout the main document may become distracting.

**Verison 2**

A color-coded border around the side previews is applied in version 2, as seen in the image below. All linked content is gray, including the links.

**Verison 3**

 A more subtle approach is taken in version 3, having underlined titles. Additionally, all linked content items are purple, while navigation icons remain gray, indicating two distinct categories of information.

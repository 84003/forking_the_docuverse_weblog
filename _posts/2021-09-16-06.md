The intent here is to clarify which concepts are to become components of the construct and how those components interact.

Questions are:
- What can documents contain?
- How are links created, and which link types?

## A Document and Its Content Items

A document is defined in general terms as a container of content items to which links can be attached on the level of the document and the level of the content item. The representation of a document can change in each view mode.

A document can contain a single or multiple content items which may vary in modality (e.g., text, image, sound). Content items may vary in modality and may be further distinguished by type. In conventional terms, a paragraph, for example, is a content item; a quote within a paragraph is also a content item; a list and a list item are content items.

## Link Types

Two main link types can be established between content items: transclusions and those that are not transclusions, called *tag links* and can include a descriptive label or remain empty.

1. **Transclusion** ----
2. **Tag link** –#–

### 1. Transclusion ----

A transclusion is created when a content item from one document is included in another document.[^excerpts] Transclusions are reused content items with visible links and thus offer a way to retrieve "the origins and context of quotations, excerpts and anthologized materials, and content transiting between versions" (Nelson Xanalogical). The image below shows the concept of transclusion on a technical level.

[^excerpts]: Conventionally, these are called excerpts and typographically classified as block quotes or inline quotes, and the link between the *copied* and the *pasted* is usually embedded as a citation.

### 2. Tag link –#–

*Tag links* are created by connecting two separate content items and can include a descriptive label (#Label) or remain empty (#). Utilizing the common usage of hashtag[^hashtag] as a means to categorize content, *tag links* enable people to organize and filter links based on their developed taxonomy. Examples of *tag links* are given below.

## Endnotes

[^hashtag]: The word hashtag refers to the symbol # (as popularized by Twitter) and combines the word hash from the hash mark and the word tag as it is used to label something belonging to a specific category.

Questions are:
- What constitutes a document?
- How are links attached?
- What link types?

## Documents, Content Items, and Link Types

A document is a container of (one or many) content items to which links can be attached (on the content item or document level). Two main link types can be established between content items: transclusions and non-transclusions — now called *taglinks*.

2. Taglink –#–

### 1. Transclusion ----

Transclusion is the inclusion of (a part of) a document into another document.[^form_of_transclusion] When a content item is reused in another document, a visual (transclusion-type) link is automatically created, offering a way to retrieve "the origins and context of quotations, excerpts and anthologized materials, and content transiting between versions" (Nelson 1999).

The image below shows the concept of transclusion on a technical level.

### 2. Taglink –#–
A taglink is any arbitrary conceptual connection created between (a part of) documents and can include a descriptive label (#Label) or remain empty (#). Utilizing the common usage of hashtags,[^hashtag] taglinks enable the organization of links based on any taxonomy. Examples of taglinks are given below.

The link types and the view modes developed so far are explored in a prototype in the [next entry](07).

## Endnotes

[^form_of_transclusion]: Content by convention inserted between quotation marks or in a block quote, for example, is a *form* of transclusion.


[^hashtag]: The word hashtag refers to the symbol # (as popularized by Twitter) and combines the word hash from the hash mark and the word tag as it is used to label something belonging to a specific category.

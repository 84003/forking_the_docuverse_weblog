In this entry, the view modes are renamed and redesigned.

- Lateral View is renamed Zoomed-In View
- Inventory View is renamed Zoomed-Out View

The main challenges in redesigning Zoomed-In View involve color coding and how cursor events change the display states of different categories of information. Those different categories of information are:

1. Link endpoints: whether a link points to an entire document or a content item within a document.
3. Link direction.
4. Link type; whether it is a transclusion or taglink.
5. Taglink labels.

Questions are:
- How should these be visualized?
- When should they be shown or hidden?
- How should they animate between a shown and hidden state?

## Link Endpoints

To distinguish between a link that points to an entire document or a content item within a document, the link's endpoint is either bracketed or pointed. Additionally, if a link points to a content item within a document, the linked content is emphasized, and if a link points to an entire document, its title is emphasized. These distinctions are demonstrated in the image below.

## Link Types

In the two images below, the version with the colored border is compared to the version with the underlined title. In both cases, the dashed line indicates a transclusion type link, and the solid line indicates a taglink.

## Position and Visualization of Taglink Labels

In the examples below, the taglink points from a particular content item in the open document (middle) to the entire side document. Specifically, the word *modality* is linked to the document titled *Defining Modality and Medium*. The direction of the taglink is visually indicated by the label *Definition*. The three images below show variations of the position of the label.

In the image above, **while not hovering** shows whether the link points to a particular content item within a document or the entire document. **While hovering** shows the label combined with the link direction.

In the image above, all information categories are shown **while not hovering**. Only the display state of the *expand* icon is toggled on the two different cursor events.

In the image above, **while not hovering** shows whether the link points to a particular content item within a document or the entire document, and **while hovering** hides the previous information and shows the label combined with the link direction.

In the [next entry](12), the design of Zoomed-In View is explored further.

## Discarded Attempts

As seen below, one of the problems with the color border is the awkward transition animation effects.

Other variations of the color-coding system are seen in the following images.

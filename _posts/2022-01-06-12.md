Alterations and additions:
- Redesign of links to distinguish:
	- Link direction
	- Link endpoint (by improving the design of the brackets)
- Color coding:
	- Title underline is replaced with border color.
- Addition of a location frame of Inventory View while in Lateral Mode.

## Link Direction and Link Endpoint

Link endpoints: distinguishing between a link that points to an entire document and a link that points to a particular part of a document. In the image below, the link is visualized as one element that indicates the link direction, link type, and link endpoint. The label is now visually separate from the link.

The image below shows what it would look like if multiple labels are attached to a taglink.

## Improvements Due

- In Lateral Mode:
  - Hovering a preview should bring that preview to the front.
  - Hovering linked text (or preview) should result in active-color linked text.
  - Visualization of multiple links to/from the same content item.
- Filter menu
- Sequence Links

## Discarded Attempts

**Alignment**

In the image below, in addition to the left-bracket link, the title, the link, the label, and the linked text are aligned to emphasize that it points from the entire document on the left to a particular part in the document on the right.

In the image below, the label is placed close to the linked text within the open document.

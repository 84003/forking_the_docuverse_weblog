I"¦<p>âœ± The purpose of this text is to give examples of both analog and digital projects based on mapping and visualizing interconnection, and in so doing, come to an understanding of what interconnection is and the many ways it has been explored in projects throughout history. so though I am expressing discontent with transferring biases and conventions from paper media to digital media, I am not saying we throw away these concepts, but consider how the constructs that we create and embed in the digital realm can serve as reconceptualizations of those conventions to better reflect interconnection (by making them visual, categorizable, and interactive). questions are: which of the significant features of historical projects are valuable and convenient for working with text? how might we design the interfaces of such systems in the digital realm for working with text, based on the intercomparison of their connections.</p>

<h2 id="to-engage-with-complexity">To Engage With Complexity</h2>

<p>The purpose of Stack View is to enable the (re)arrangement of a selection of documents in a particular order for entering Merge View. Creating <em>stacks</em> is supposed to be a convenient method for engaging with complexity by selecting which to view in more detail. Shifting from a 2D to a 3D perspective may obfuscate and not serve that purpose well.<sup id="fnref:filtering_technique" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:filtering_technique" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>In abandoning Stack View, proceeding first requires defining the basic concepts more clearly. Questions are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What constitutes a document?</li>
  <li>How are links attached?</li>
  <li>What link types?</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions are explored in the <a href="06">next entry</a>.</p>

      <p>A filtering technique might be a better solution, which requires a grouping mechanism (explored in <a href="8">entry 08</a>).Â <a href="#fnref:filtering_technique" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

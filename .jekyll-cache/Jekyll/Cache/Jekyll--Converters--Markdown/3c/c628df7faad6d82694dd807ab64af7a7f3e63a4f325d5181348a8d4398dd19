I"Ùå<p>The first section of this entry introduces the concept of interconnection, the various terms used to express the idea of interconnection across fields, and the underlying philosophical position. The second section examines analog and digital systems developed throughout history, comprising concepts for representing interconnection. Those concepts are juxtaposed to how they have been implemented in commonly known systems, such as how hypertext is implemented on the Web. The biases and conventions inherited from paper documents are also discussed, including the (dis)advantages of transferring these (or how these have been transferred) to the digital realm. The aim is to gather insight into which features of the systems can be utilized in creating a construct based on accommodating interconnection.</p>

<p>The motivation behind this approach resonates with what Mary Hopper stated in her introduction to the 1998 symposium <em>Hypertext in Historical Context: Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson Revisited</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider that there may be vast potentials in electronic media that we still haven‚Äôt implemented, and we may be in danger of missing some of the greatest potential in electronic media because we mistake some situational limitations in technical development or project management for impossibility. This is the grounds upon which I suggest that the past is of more than just historical interest. The past, and the pioneers who shaped the past, may hold many suggestions as to paths it might be valuable to explore in the future and advice on the most productive ways to go down those paths. (Hopper 1998)</p>

<h2 id="interconnection">Interconnection</h2>

<p>The concept of interconnection denotes the various connections among the content items<sup id="fnref:content_item" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:content_item" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> of documents. As Ted Nelson (1987) explains, connections can be internal or external to a document, stated implicitly or explicitly. For example, phrases such as ‚Äúin the example given below‚Äù or ‚Äúas defined previously‚Äù establish <strong>implicit internal connections</strong>.  <strong>Explicit internal connections</strong> are content items that by convention take the form of a footnote or marginal annotations ‚Äî the content of which can be a commentary on an idea, clarification of a term, parenthetical information and suchlike. <strong>Explicit external connections</strong> are inclusions of one document segment into another (what Nelson (1980) coined transclusions) or some other direct connection by way of reference. Interconnection thus implies multiple potential structures other than the paragraph-by-paragraph sequence of text.</p>

<p>There are terms other than <em>interconnection</em> that denote the various connections between documents. As Borgman (2015) writes, ‚Äú[t]he body of relationships among documents is sometimes known as ‚Äò<em>hypertextuality</em>.‚Äô‚Äù <em>Hypertext</em> is commonly associated with how it has been implemented on the Web, understood in general terms as ‚Äúa computer construct of links and data corresponding to files or parts of files that can be displayed in windows of various dimensions (Vandendorpe 2009).‚Äù Another term, used particularly within semiotics and literary theory, is <em>intertextuality</em> which describes abstract connections, ‚Äúas in the influence of one text on the meaning of another‚Äù (Borgman 2015). One such connection can be how one text is derived from a preceding text, as with Ulysses by James Joyce, which is a transformation of Odyssey by Homer (Vandendorpe 2009). In the definition of an <em>intertext</em> as it was first proposed, there is an emphasis on the perception of the reader, namely that the connections between one text and one that preceded or followed it results from the activity of reading (Vanderndorpe 2009). Ted Nelson (2015) calls it <em>intertwingularity</em> which ‚Äúexpresses a philosophical position about cross-connection,‚Äù namely that ‚Äúall subjects and issues are intertwined and intermingled.‚Äù</p>

<p><em>Hypertextuality</em>, <em>intertextuality</em>, and <em>intertwingularity</em> coincide but not completely. These terms are similar yet different lenses (used within particular fields) to view documents for mapping multiple structures by establishing connections. <em>Interconnection</em> is a general term chosen and used to encompass these various connections between documents that ultimately result in complex layers of information. These connections can be established through reading and writing, but also through computational methods, such as applying natural language processing techniques for classifying text and keyword extraction. In what follows, analog and digital systems comprising concepts for representing interconnection are examined.</p>

<h2 id="analog-and-digital-systems">Analog and Digital Systems</h2>

<p>Three examples are examined in detail to gather insight into which features of early systems can be utilized to create a construct based on accommodating interconnection.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Encyclop√©die by Denis Diderot and Jean d‚ÄôAlembert.</li>
  <li>The work of Paul Otlet.</li>
  <li>The original hypertext project Xanadu by Ted Nelson.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first two examples are both analog systems. The first is a closed system of internal connections, and the second is an exploration of an open system of connections based on a multidimensional structure. The third is a digital system based on a multidimensional and continuously evolving structure, envisioning the potential of the computer as a <em>literary machine</em> with consideration of its distinctive properties.<sup id="fnref:distinctive_properties" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:distinctive_properties" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> All three examples share the conceptualization of documents as made up of parts that can be linked through some mechanism.</p>

<h3 id="1-encyclop√©die-by-diderot-and-dalembert">1 Encyclop√©die by Diderot and d‚ÄôAlembert</h3>

<p>Various information technologies for mapping interconnection (non-)hierarchically were produced in the eighteenth century, ranging from atlases, encyclopedias, dictionaries, and suchlike. The Encyclop√©die by Diderot and d‚ÄôAlembert is a prominent example that, as Rosenberg (2015) argues, was an innovative system for its time. In its entirety, the Encyclop√©die is a system of <em>intraconnections</em> ‚Äî which is to say, a closed system of internal connections ‚Äî ‚Äúcomprising 28 volumes, 72,000 articles by over 2,000 writers, and more than 3,000 plates‚Äù (Rosenberg 2015). Though the design incorporates concepts for representing external connections, the Encyclop√©die was conceived and meant to be used as an independent system. A significant feature is the multiple renditions of the contents, offering multiple entry points to the articles. One structure of the Encyclop√©die is the alphabetical structure, embedded as running headers throughout the encyclopedia (seen in the image below), allowing access to content by keyword.</p>

<p><img src="assets/encyclopdie_vol01_internet_archives_AMA.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Transcluded from <a href="https://archive.org/details/encyclopdieoud01alem/page/312/mode/2up">Internet Archive</a></em></p>

<p>Other ways of accessing content are through the annotated diagrams functioning as visual indexes. A tree diagram from the first volume is seen in the image below.</p>

<p><img src="assets/encyclopdie_vol01_internet_archives_tree_map.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Transcluded from <a href="https://archive.org/details/encyclopdieoud01alem/page/n69/mode/1up">Internet Archive</a></em></p>

<p>These textual and diagrammatic ways of mapping structures are hierarchical, as was the convention at the time. However, as Rosenberg explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Older encyclopedias were generally organized hierarchically and by subject. Theirs was designed to be navigated by keyword, to allow readers to enter and exit at any useful point. Additionally, their encyclopedia was hypertexted. Articles were linked in a web through a system of renvois or cross-references. The Encyclop√©die also offered a hierarchical subject map, echoing the structure of older works, but, in the work of Diderot and d‚ÄôAlembert, the tree of knowledge was presented as only one of several heuristics. (Rosenberg 2015)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, as the computer-generated diagram (seen in the image below) elucidate, ‚Äúimplicit in the system of cross-references of the Encyclop√©die‚Äù (Rosenberg 2015) is an underlying network structure in which there are many-to-many relationships among subjects.</p>

<p><img src="assets/diderot_encyclopedie_map_crop.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Diagram by Olsen and Blanchard (transcluded from Rosenberg (2015))</em></p>

<p>First, the diagram elucidates that conceiving knowledge as fundamentally hierarchical is not ‚Äúparadigmatic of Enlightenment epistemology.‚Äù Second, nor is it intrinsic to print. Rather, all subjects are interconnected, and as Rosenberg argues, though the</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>network diagram would not have been familiar to the generation of the Encyclopedists, the concepts behind it were. They too were thinking about intellectual phenomena in terms of underlying structures and aggregate relationships. (Rosenberg 2015)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="2-the-work-of-paul-otlet">2 The Work of Paul Otlet</h3>

<p>The work of Paul Otlet ‚Äî regarded as a pioneer of the field once called documentation that branched into what is now called information science (Le Deuff and Perret 2019) ‚Äî range from devising the model called Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records in which entities are linked on multiple levels in the form of a network (Borgman 2015) to developing new approaches to organizing and accessing information by establishing theoretical principles of information. Additionally, Otlet explored how information organization might be in the future in the form of illustrations serving as metaphors of a global network of documents once media other than the book would take precedence (Heuvel and Rayward 2011).</p>

<p>Similar to the Encyclop√©die ‚Äî a project that is seen as in response to the eighteenth-century information overload (Rosenberg 2015) ‚Äî Otlet‚Äôs work was in response to the problem of ‚Äúthe enormous growth in the number of publications, specialist congresses, and international exhibitions that began to occur at the end of the nineteenth century‚Äù (Manfroid 2013).</p>

<p>As Rayward (1994) formulates it, the problem that Otlet analyzed and explored solutions to was ‚Äúhow most effectively to create, maintain, and change institutional arrangements for collecting, storing, preserving, organizing, retrieving, and disseminating all of the recorded information that is-or will be-needed within society.‚Äù With that complex problem at hand, Otlet envisioned new approaches to storing, organizing, and disseminating information while accommodating expansive growth and extensive reuse.</p>

<p>A significant feature of the work by Otlet is the conceptualization of text as modular ‚Äî made up of parts connected to other parts (internal and external to a document). An appropriate system, according to Otlet, must therefore allow and facilitate establishing links between these <em>parts</em> (i.e., content items). In designing such a system, Otlet explored the re-conceptualization of the Book as a global system of documents. As told by Heuvel and Rayward:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a 1911 lecture on the future of the book and of bibliography, Otlet came back to the idea he had first expressed in 1892 and in subsequent publications: ‚ÄòThe arbitrary division into lines and pages of the book in its present format, does not at all correspond all with the presentation of ideas‚Äô (p. 291). He envisioned the emergence of a future format of the book in which ‚Äòeach intellectual element, in corresponding to a physical element, will create a structure such that any combination of ideas, notions, and facts will be possible.‚Äô He suggested that this process can operate in so mechanical a fashion that in the future, the book will truly become a machine to think with (Otlet transcluded from Heuvel and Rayward (2011))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the illustrations below suggest, for Otlet, the development of such a system entails <em>ripping</em> content items (representing ideas, notions, facts) from books and collecting each on separate paper cards.</p>

<p><img src="assets/the-book-in-connection-with-the-library-the-bibliographic-repertory-and-encyclopedia.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Global Network of Universal Documentation (transcluded from Heuvel and Rayward (2011))</em></p>

<p>The illustration below expresses a similar notion about the structure of ideas and how knowledge evolves.</p>

<p><img src="assets/otlet_raite_de_documentation.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Title and Source</em></p>

<!-- %%find source%% -->

<p>With this conceptualization of ideas and knowledge, Otlet based his system on having the capacity to accommodate expansive growth and extensive reuse. For Otlet, this meant the capacity to both store and access content items through links and metadata. Otlet explored a paper card-based system to establish multidimensional links between content items, seen in the image below.</p>

<p><img src="assets/otlet_card_experiments.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Multidimensional card system (transcluded from Heuvel and Rayward (2011))</em></p>

<p>As Otlet writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To increase the number of sides, one might well abandon the rectangular form of the card and adopt a polygonal form, an octagon for example. For sorting and systematically selecting the ideas that have been classified hierarchically, the cards are suspended from their centre. The Book as a structure of cards thus takes a quasi-circular form and can rotate. [I]ts structure [‚Ä¶] constitutes a Book‚Äîfor it is still a book‚Äîthat has abandoned the traditional form of linear text arranged according to a unique plan. It has been transformed in some way into a body with several dimensions, as many dimensions as headings such that different searches using the same graphic elements on the cards are possible. (Otlet transcluded from Heuvel and Rayward (2011))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Heuvel and Rayward (2011) point out, though the material manifestation of such a paper card system is ‚Äúimpractical for many reasons,‚Äù what Otlet is describing is an open system for mapping and accessing content, based on the interconnection of subjects. Beyond these experiments with paper cards, Otlet envisioned new visual representations and approaches to accessing content. For example, in the image below, ‚ÄúOtlet uses the architectural metaphor of the factory to visualize this process‚Äù (Heuvel 2017).</p>

<p><img src="assets/otlet_mundaneum.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Laboratorium Mundaneum (transcluded from <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Laboratorium_Mundaneum.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a>)</em></p>

<p>Though the material constraints of paper-based technologies inhibited Otlet (e.g., books, paper cards, shelves, cabinets, and desks), he envisioned new ways of organizing and accessing information beyond what Adriaan van der Weel (2012) calls the <em>order of the book</em>.<sup id="fnref:order_of_the_book" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:order_of_the_book" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="3-xanadu-by-ted-nelson">3 Xanadu by Ted Nelson</h3>

<p>Nelson is most known for inventing the <em>back button</em>, and developing concepts such as <em>hypertext</em>, <em>virtuality</em>, and the <em>docuverse</em>. Hypertext is likely the most known but is merely one of the many concepts Nelson has spent decades developing within a larger project called Xanadu. Though Xanadu has never been fully implemented, the many prototypes and writings throughout the decades since the 1960s have had a profound impact on the evolution of hypertext, influencing several projects including the World Wide Web, ‚Äúas its own inventor Tim Berners-Lee acknowledged‚Äù (Ridi 2018).</p>

<p>Xanadu is a hypertext system, a docuverse, technically a piece of software that since its conception has been designed to run on a global network of computers in which every document is to reside (Ridi 2018). Much akin to the work of Otlet, Xanadu is based on particular notions about how knowledge evolves and the structure of ideas. As Nelson writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The physical universe is not all that decays. So do abstraction and categories. Human ideas, science, scholarship, and language constantly collapsing and unfolding. Any field, and the corpus of all fields, is a bundle of relationships subject to all kinds of twists, inversions, involutions, and rearrangement. (Nelson 1965)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Nelson, it is this continuous evolution that a system must be designed to accommodate ‚Äî to have the capacity for new categorization systems and any arrangements of old and new content. On the structure of thoughts and ideas, Nelson writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[A]s you consider a thing, your thoughts crisscross it constantly, reviewing first one connection, then another. Each new idea is compared with many parts of the whole picture, or with some mental visualization of the whole picture itself. (Nelson 1987)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In line with the notion that the structure of ideas is nonsequential, in his book Literary Machines (first published in 1980), Nelson defines <em>hypertext</em> as ‚Äúnonsequential writing‚Äîtext that branches and allows choices to the reader‚Äù (Nelson 1987). Whereas writing and structuring sequential text entails choosing ‚Äúone expository sequence from among the possible myriad,‚Äù writing nonsequential text entails deciding on the ‚Äúinterconnective structure‚Äù ‚Äî ‚Äúwhere to put things in the searchable maze‚Äù (Nelson 1987). It is based on these definitions and notions about how ideas and knowledge evolve that Nelson envisioned Xanadu.</p>

<p>Xanadu has gone through many revisions and different prototype implementations over the span of six decades, but the core concepts have fundamentally remained the same. In what follows, those concepts are examined with reflections on some of the implementations and juxtaposed to how some of its concepts are implemented on the Web.</p>

<p><strong>History Management</strong></p>

<p>Xanadu is a system that stores (and makes accessible) every change made to documents‚Äô contents and linkages, integrated in such a way that former states can be retrieved and reworked (Nelson 1987). As seen in the image below, people can choose whether those changes are local/private or online/public.</p>

<p><img src="assets/nelson_public_private.png" alt="" />
<em>Transcluded from Nelson (1987)</em></p>

<p>Once a document is online/public, any changes made (e.g., if the author revises the content, or readers reuse parts of a document or create links to/from a document) are stored; effectively, the history of every document is accessible to anyone. This would be the same if the Web were built with an integrated history management system such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a>, not as an optional tool but as a core feature.</p>

<p><strong>Bidirectional Visual Links</strong></p>

<p>Beyond the history dimension, the multidimensional structure of Xanadu is designed for two main categories of connections between documents, expressed by two link types: <em>content links</em> and <em>transclusions</em>. Content links are the arbitrary connections that people (writers and readers) create as they engage with text, and <em>transclusions</em> are reused content items. By convention, transclusions are what are known as excerpts and typographically distinguished as block quotes or inline quotes, and the link between the <em>copied</em> and the <em>pasted</em> is usually embedded as a citation. However, as Nelson writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Transclusion is what quotation, copying and cross-referencing merely attempt: they are ways that people have had to <em>imitate</em> transclusion, which is the true abstract relationship that paper cannot show. (Nelson 1999)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Content items are not duplicated; rather, <em>transcluded</em> ‚Äî included in a document with a visual link to the original document. Additionally, since all links are bidirectional, every outward and inward-pointing link is accessible, which means the original document also points to documents that reuse parts of its contents. In this way, transclusions offer a way to retrieve ‚Äúthe origins and context of quotations, excerpts and anthologized materials, and content transiting between versions‚Äù (Nelson 1999). Important to note is that links are not embedded but technically implemented as an overlay, much akin to ‚Äúa cache, or an alias on the desktop‚Äù (Nelson 1999). This technicality enables multiple overlapping links in the same document. Additionally, because all changes are stored, even if the original document undergoes changes, it is always possible to view the content item in its original context at the time it was transcluded.</p>

<p>In contrast, links on the Web are embedded (in HTML) and only point outward. When a website is cited as a source in a text, it usually indicates the date the website was accessed. However, if the contents of the website have been deleted or changed since then, though the date on which it was updated might be displayed, there is no way of accessing previous versions. Additionally, link endpoints on the Web are at the level of the document, or <em>page</em> rather,<sup id="fnref:links_on_the_web" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:links_on_the_web" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> whereas, in Xanadu, link endpoints are at the level of the content item. The implication is that a link can point from a particular part of a document to a particular part of another document. As for how this would look and work, Nelson envisioned Xanadu as a system in which documents are viewed side-by-side with visual links, expressed by two concepts: <em>parallel documents</em> and <em>transpointing windows</em> (Nelson 1999).</p>

<p><img src="assets/hypernotes01.png" alt="" />
An improvement would be landing at the particular linked part of a document:
<img src="assets/hypernotes03.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Side-By-Side Documents With Visual Links</strong></p>

<p>Parallel documents, according to Nelson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>are everywhere, but are not generally acknowledged. There are relatively few explicitly parallel documents (like Tom Stoppard‚Äôs play ‚ÄúRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead‚Äù, which is explicitly parallel to ‚ÄúHamlet‚Äù ‚Äì showing events that occur offstage in ‚ÄúHamlet‚Äù, and vice versa). But implicitly parallel documents are everywhere ‚Äì the parallelism of commentaries, the parallelism of long and short versions of reports, the parallelism of translations, the parallelism of holy books. (Nelson 1998)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Engaging with text should entail viewing documents side-by-side with <em>transpointing windows</em>, which are meant to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>support analysis and detailed understanding ‚Äì by parallel commentary, precise annotation and the explication of contents; by the facilitation of pinpoint controversy. These are needed not just in scholarship, but legislation, diplomacy, and anywhere that interrelated documents need to be seen[‚Ä¶for] detailed explication, commentary or disagreement[, and for] comparing successive versions of a document. (Nelson 1999)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A prototype from 2003, in which the links are solid lines, pointing to and from content items within windows, is seen in the image below.<sup id="fnref:2003_prototype" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2003_prototype" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="assets/nelson_cosmicbook.png" alt="" />
<em>Transcluded from Nelson (2015)</em></p>

<p>In another prototype, the links are applied not as solid lines but as color-coded highlights. Additionally, the main document is placed in the middle, and the linked documents are placed on the left and right sides with a smaller font size.</p>

<p><img src="assets/xanadoc.png" alt="" />
<em>Screenshot of Xanadoc (try the interactive demo <a href="https://xanadu.com/xanademos/MoeJusteOrigins.html">here</a>)</em></p>

<p>In the latest Xanadu prototype, which is in 3D,<sup id="fnref:3D_prototype" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3D_prototype" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> the linked documents appear on the sides when moving through the contents, or as Nelson puts it: ‚Äúall objects sworfing (swooping and/or morphing) together‚Äù (Nelson 2016).</p>

<p><img src="assets/nelson_click_full_frame.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="assets/xanaduspace_2007.png" alt="" />
<em>Transcluded from Nelson (2016)</em></p>

<p>A demonstration of <em>sworfing</em> is given by Nelson in the video below.<sup id="fnref:sworfing" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sworfing" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1yLNGUeHapA?start=274" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>These prototypes prompt a reasonable concern: how to manage the complexity that may (most definitely) result from creating multiple overlapping <em>transclusions</em> and <em>content links</em>. Moreover, there can be an infinite number of sub-categories within the two main categories of link types. Whereas Otlet‚Äôs experiments with paper cards are impractical in terms of implementation because of material constraints, the problem of creating and mapping structures in the digital realm has to do with how to display and interact with the resulting complex information. This, of course, has been a central concern for decades, as suggested by Conklin (1987) in his analysis of hypertext systems in the 1980s.</p>

<p><img src="assets/conklin_fig11.png" alt="" />
<em>Transcluded from Conklin (1987)</em></p>

<p>Nelson refers to it as the <em>framing problem</em> (seen in the image below), to which he notes that ‚Äúfiltering links is a key aspect of front-end design [which] is a separate study in itself‚Äù (Nelson 1987).<sup id="fnref:front-end-design" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:front-end-design" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="a-selection-of-system-features">A Selection of System Features</h2>

<p>Discussed below are a selection of features of the three examples that will be reworked and incorporated in the design of the construct.</p>

<p>Significant to the design of the Encyclop√©die is that there are multiple points of entry through both textual and visual renditions of its contents, which in the construct can be implemented as different view modes. The computer-generated diagram, elucidating the underlying network structure of connections within the Encyclop√©die, is deemed particularly useful for gaining an infographic-like overview of the number of connections between documents. As seen in Otlet‚Äôs illustrations of the evolution of knowledge, it is essentially a process of decomposition and recomposition of parts. To facilitate that process, several links pointing to the same part of a document should be possible. In addition to attaching links between content items, it should be possible to attach metadata to documents to establish connections. Xanadu is a system with a multidimensional structure designed to accommodate two main link types: those created when establishing arbitrary connections and those created when content items of one document are reused in another document. This categorical distinction is deemed useful, but a design solution is required for the various sub-categories within the arbitrary connections, allowing the possibility to filter links. As shared by all three examples, the design of the construct will also be based on the conception of documents as made up of parts that can be linked through some mechanism. This implies the possibility for a link to point to an entire document or a particular content item within a document. Lastly, designing the construct will explore the visual form of links, how to indicate the link direction, and how to provide direct access to linked documents, whether by viewing documents side-by-side or some other means.</p>

      <p>Content items are what Steven DeRose (1990) calls ‚Äúcontent objects,‚Äù what Charles van den Heuvel and W. Boyd Rayward (2011) call ‚Äúinformation chunks,‚Äù and what Ridi (2018) calls ‚Äúinformation units.‚Äù In conventional terms, a paragraph, for example, is a content item; a quote within a paragraph is also a content item; a list and a list item are content items.¬†<a href="#fnref:content_item" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:distinctive_properties" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>These distinctive properties, as discussed under the question <em>What are the distinct properties of a digital document versus a paper document?</em> in [Questions That Follow], means the computer holds greater potential than earlier analog mediums. Firstly, that the computer is a <em>universal machine</em> means ‚Äúthat it is an instrument capable of performing on text not only all medial functions such as creating, editing, storing, publishing, distributing and consuming it, but also operations of various kinds. [F]unctioning electronically and digitally, [it can] run every conceivable type of application (Weel 2012),‚Äù which by implication means that any conceivable construct can be embedded. A third distinctive property, which engendered transformative change, is that once computers began operating in a global digital network, the ‚Äúmedial role‚Äù of the computer went from being a tool for aiding ‚Äútext production and printing to that of a wholly new digital medium in its own right‚Äù (Weel 2012). It became the medium that ‚Äúcovers the entire communications circuit, including the production (writing, editing) of texts, down to their distribution and even consumption‚Äù (Weel 2012). Nelson considered the potential of these properties for envisioning how the computer could become a <em>literary machine</em> transforming how we engage and work with text.¬†<a href="#fnref:distinctive_properties" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:order_of_the_book" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>As stated in [Questions That Follow], the <em>order of the book</em> is the presentation and structure of text based on the form of books and defined by the format of manuscript and print.¬†<a href="#fnref:order_of_the_book" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:links_on_the_web" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Traversing content on the Web by selecting hyperlinks commonly entails blindly <em>jumping</em> and landing at the top of the page:¬†<a href="#fnref:links_on_the_web" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:2003_prototype" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Note that the link direction is unclear, and the position and overlap of the windows are not convenient.¬†<a href="#fnref:2003_prototype" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:3D_prototype" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>One problem with this 3D version is that there is no obvious way of navigating the space. For reading and editing a document, it could be useful to snap into a full-frame view of a particular part of a document.¬†<a href="#fnref:3D_prototype" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:sworfing" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>The idea of viewing documents side-by-side is solid, but having documents fly in and out of view as you move through the document is not. There should be an interaction step in between, in which the content is only opened through deliberate action.¬†<a href="#fnref:sworfing" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

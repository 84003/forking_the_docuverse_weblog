<p>View modes are different levels of perspective on documents. In addition, the two view modes differ in the components used for representing the concept of a document.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Inventory View</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>At the level of the collection.</li>
      <li>Two-dimensional node-link diagram.</li>
      <li>Displays quantity of connections between documents.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Stack View</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>At the level of a selection of the collection.</li>
      <li>Three-dimensional layers.</li>
      <li>Displays selection of connections and distinct connection types.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Merge Mode</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>At the level of content objects.</li>
      <li>Two-dimensional frame.</li>
      <li>Displays connections side-by-side or sequentially.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-inventory-view">1. Inventory View</h3>

<p><img src="assets/BP_01.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In this view mode the entire inventory is visible and represented as a diagram in which a <strong>node</strong> denotes a document and a <strong>link</strong> denotes connections of varying types (specified below).</p>

<p><img src="assets/BP_02.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Node</strong></p>

<p>The size of a node reflects the number of content objects it contains (i.e. the size of the document).</p>

<p><strong>Link</strong></p>

<p>The length of a link reflects the number of links between the content objects across documents. Those documents that have the most links between them therefore form clusters.</p>

<p><img src="assets/BP_03.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As seen in the image above, from Inventory View it is possible to select nodes to create a stack and enter Stack View.</p>

<h3 id="2-stack-view">2. Stack View</h3>

<p>A <strong>stack</strong> is made up of a set of documents represented as <strong>layers</strong> that contain <strong>content objects</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="assets/BP_A.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Stack</strong></p>

<p>A stack can be thought of as a workspace. The inventory in its entirety may contain complex layers of information, and so creating stacks is a convenient method for engaging with complexity by making a selection of which to view in more detail.</p>

<p><strong>Layer</strong></p>

<p>The concept of a document is represented as a layer, which instead of having a single title, has a single tag and appropriates its functionalities. In the image below there are four layers: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#MAIN</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#A</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#B</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#C</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Content Object</strong></p>

<p>Content objects are the parts that make up a text, of which there are many types: paragraphs, lists, emphatic phrases, titles, quotes, comments and so on. A content object can have any number of tags, placing it in multiple layers.</p>

<p><img src="assets/BP_B.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Link Types</strong></p>

<p>In the image below there are several links between the layers. As defined in the <a href="boundaries-of-documents-and-reflecting-interconnection">previous entry</a>, there are two general types of connections that cross the boundaries of documents: those that are transclusions (identical extracts in separate documents), and those that are not. In the image below, these two types are visually distinguished by dot-line-dot links and side-surface links.</p>

<p>*Note: it is important that these are visually distinguished but the visualization is subject to change.</p>

<p><img src="assets/BP_C.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For the links that are not transclusions, these are categorized according to whichever taxonomy people wish to develop within the construct, hence the appropriation of a tagging system. By example, in the image below, if content object <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ID_P2</code> is a comment on content object <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ID_P1</code>, then the layer could be tagged <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#COMMENTS</code>. If the other two layers are separate references, these layers could be tagged <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#REFERENCE_X</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#REFERENCE_Y</code>.</p>

<p><img src="assets/BP_D.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is also possible to display links only between a selection of layers in the stack. Upon selection, the stack is rearranged. In the two images below the layers <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#MAIN</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#COMMENTS</code> are selected, displaying the links between them, followed by stack rearrangement.</p>

<p><img src="assets/BP_X.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="assets/BP_X2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>While in Stack View it is possible to merge all or a selection of layers. The arrangement of the stack will determine how the layers are merged.</p>

<h3 id="3-merge-mode">3. Merge Mode</h3>

<p>In the image below, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#MAIN</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#COMMENTS</code> are merged side by side.</p>

<p><img src="assets/BP_Y.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the image below, only the linked content objects (between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#MAIN</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#COMMENTS</code>) are displayed side by side.</p>

<p><img src="assets/BP_Z1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The image below shows the option for merging the content objects sequentially. If another layer was included, the order would depend on the arrangement of layers in Stack View.</p>

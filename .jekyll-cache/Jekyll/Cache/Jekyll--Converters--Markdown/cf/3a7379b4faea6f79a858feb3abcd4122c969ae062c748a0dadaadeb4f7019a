<h2 id="content-items-and-link-types">Content Items and Link Types</h2>

<p>Based on the definition of the concept of a document given in a <a href="03">previous entry</a>, the intent here is to define what documents can contain and how links (and what type of links) can be established.</p>

<p>A document can contain one or many content items (previously called content objects). A content item can be an image, a graph, or a (paragraph-like) text segment. There are two link types that can be established between content items, namely, those that are transclusions and those that are not transclusions. For the latter, these link types are established by means of a tag, which can include a descriptive title or remain untitled.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Transclusions</strong> (‚Äì‚Äì)</li>
  <li><strong>Tag Links</strong> (#)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-transclusions">1. Transclusions</h3>
<p>Transclusion links are created when extracting a text segment from one document and inserting it into another document. Traditionally these are called excerpts and typographically classified as block quotes or inline quotes, and the link between the ‚Äúcopied‚Äù and the ‚Äúpasted‚Äù is usually embedded as a citation.</p>

<p>Similar to how Ted Nelson envisioned links in his hypertext system Xanadu, within the construct, a transclusion link is visualized as a line between documents. The image below shows the concept of transclusion on a technical level.</p>

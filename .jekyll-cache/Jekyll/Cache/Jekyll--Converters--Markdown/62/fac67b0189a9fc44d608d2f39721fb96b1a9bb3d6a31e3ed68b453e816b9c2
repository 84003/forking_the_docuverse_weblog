I"I<p>This entry discusses points for improving the design presented in the <a href="04">previous entry</a>, particularly Stack View.</p>

<h2 id="engaging-with-complexity">Engaging With Complexity</h2>

<p>The purpose of Stack View is to enable the arrangement of a set of selected documents in a particular order for entering Merge View. Creating stacks is supposed to be a convenient method for engaging with complexity by selecting which to view in more detail. However, shifting from a 2D to a 3D perspective may obfuscate and not serve that purpose well. A filtering technique might be a better solution (explored in <a href="8">entry 08</a>). In abandoning Stack View, proceeding first requires definitions of the basic concepts, how these concepts become components, and then how these components interact.</p>

<p>Questions are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What constitutes a document in the construct?</li>
  <li>How are links attached, and how do they operate?</li>
</ul>

<p>Improvements due:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Labels should also be attached to links.</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="06">next entry</a>.</p>

I"<p>Ted Nelson envisioned the docuverse implemented with bi-directional visual links that have been explored in many models and prototypes:</p>

<p>As discussed in a <a href="03">previous entry</a>, working with documents side-by-side and visual links is beneficial. One of the benefits is that content included in one document from another (i.e., transclusion) is directly and visually available for cross-examination. Direct access to the original context enables the ability to assess whether the meaning conveyed in the original document has been misconstrued in other documents. On the Web, links are one-directional, and the linked documents (if at all) take the form of previews (of the <em>web page</em>, not a particular content item)<sup id="fnref:links_on_the_web" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:links_on_the_web" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> as the cursor hovers on a hyperlink.</p>

An improvement would be landing at the particular linked part of a document:

<p>As has been explored in the interactive prototypes so far, some issues come with visual links between documents, mainly having to do with the complexity of information as various links crisscross each other. Several ideas for dealing with that complexity have been explored, some of which have been implemented as prototypes:</p>

<p><strong>Layers</strong></p>

<p><img src="assets/Ideas_page_28.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Expandable grids</strong></p>

<p><img src="assets/Ideas_page_25.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Modular hierarchical blocks linked non-hierarchically</strong></p>

<p><strong>Layout inspired by concept maps</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sets of sequential content items (re)arranged in a stack</strong></p>

<p><img src="assets/Ideas_page_29.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Applying tags to links and documents</strong></p>

<p><img src="assets/Ideas_page_72.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the <a href="08">previous entry</a>, the possibility to apply #Labels to tag links (and document metadata) in order to filter information was introduced, which is deemed useful, particularly in Inventory View. However, in Lateral Mode, the crisscrossing visual links between documents is potentially distracting and does not make interacting with the connections manageable. In the <a href="08">previous entry</a>, the proposed solution took the form of preview icons that are only visible on deliberate action (i.e., as the cursor hovers a link). That proposal, however, results in the same problem as with links on the Web: the link endpoint is not seen and to view a linked document means leaving the currently open document. A new representation of linked documents (in Lateral Mode) is explored in the <a href="10">next entry</a>.</p>

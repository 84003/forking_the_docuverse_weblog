I"h <p>The attempt here is to elaborate on the terms used in the <a href="01">previous entry</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-meant-by-paper-text">What is meant by <em>paper text</em>?</h3>

<p>The use of the terms <em>paper text</em> and <em>digital text</em> is meant to emphasize the primary modality (i.e. data type) of the contents of a document, and the medium (i.e. equipment) used for its transmission. The contents of a document under the category paper text is primarily text and the medium used for its transmission is paper, which means it includes both manuscript and print. Though the contents of a paper text is primarily encoded language in graphic form, it variably contains graphics such as charts, maps, illustrations, and so on. In terms of engaging with paper text, it follows that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Text interpretation involves processes of reading texts, graphics, tables, etc.—be they external sources or one’s own text—and constructing mental representations from it. [And writing] includes activities such as creating visual-spatial representations, pictures, and graphs. (Zahn 2017)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, engaging with paper text requires familiarity with conventions developed for communicating about text structure.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-those-conventions">What are those conventions?</h3>

<p>At the most basic level, an example of a convention developed for reading and writing text is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the use of spaces between words. Classical Greek and Roman texts were written in what is called ‘continuous script’, without spaces […] Gradually, an increasing number of design and layout aids were introduced: […] capital letters at the beginning of sentences, line breaks, and a variety of punctuation marks such as commas, semicolons, colons and periods. Also, concepts such as paragraphs and chapters developed into a standardized system that allowed the structure intended by the authors to be transmitted to readers familiar with these standards. (Bruijn 2015)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Conventions particular to paper text are those derived from what Van der Weel calls <em>Order of the Book</em> — that is, presentation and structure of text based on the form of books and defined by the format of manuscript and print (van der Weel 2012). Engaging with paper text thus require a familiarity with concepts such as a table of contents, chapters, running headers, page numbers, and the interplay between them. Some such conventions were inherited by digital text.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-is-meant-by-digital-text">So what is meant by <em>digital text</em>?</h3>

<p>A digital text primarily contains the modality text and the medium used for its transmission is digital computers. Operating under the premise that the medium used for the transmission of text yield particular constraints and capacities, relevant to the juxtaposition of digital text and paper text are the following distinguishing properties:</p>

<h4 id="1-paper-text-is-inscribed-and-static-digital-text-is-encoded-and-dynamic">1. Paper text is inscribed and static; digital text is encoded and dynamic.</h4>

<p>With text on the paper page, language takes a static material form. From a historical perspective, the materialization of language had a great impact on human cognition. In <em>The Mind on Paper: Reading, Consciousness and Rationality</em>, developmental psychologist David Olson (2017) gives an analysis incorporating a historical account of the relationship between literacy and forms of thought. By his account, engaging with paper text engendered critical thinking and systematic knowledge (Olson 2017). Similar claims are made by Eric Havelock (1976), who in <em>Origins of Western Literacy</em> establishes an integral relationship between the technology of writing and rational and analytic thought. By example from research within the learning sciences, Roy Pea (1985) discusses the form of arguments contrasting oral and written language and its impact on logical analysis. With text on the paper page, human memory capacity was extended, allowing an argument to be stored and directly available to the reader/writer to evaluate the relationship between its parts (e.g. premises, (sub)claims, main claim) for consistency and locate potential contradictions. With the advent of print technology in particular, there was a greater capacity for “precision in the transmission of detail” leading to a “much greater exactness in the representation of knowledge […] through the use of such typically typographic aids as tables and different typefaces, font sizes, and white space as a means of ordering information” (van der Weel 2012).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Uniformity, predictability, consistency, and standardisation were prerequisites for analytical and scientific thinking. (van der Weel 2012)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These effects on human cognition are related to the staticity of (and what it entails to engage with) paper text. In contrast, digital text is marked by dynamicity and modifiability. At a basic level digital text is encoded as a bit pattern (e.g. 1010111) representing a character unit (e.g. W). As Stéfan Sinclair and Geoffrey Rockwell (2016) suggest, these properties of digital text imply an infinite potential for rearrangement and restructuring through algorithmic play (i.e. move these bits here to there, extract only those bits, rearrange them according to this, then that, and put those here). At yet another level, digital text is encoded by means of a markup language, which entails “marking up” the structure of a text, the visual presentation and the metadata—all of which can be utilized in tinkering with (the form, content, and meaning of) digital text. Importantly, modification of digital text by tinkering with the code that transcribes the text can be done without repercussions to source content. That is, in the process of rearranging parts, transforming between formats, extracting and sorting text segments, annotating or performing analyses on those extracted text segments, and so on — these operations can be performed without repercussions to the source content. With paper text, such actions are enacted directly upon on the material, and so additional information (e.g. annotations, symbols, citations, footnotes, and so on) is conventionally congested on the same page, which leads to the second distinguishing properties:</p>

<h4 id="2-with-paper-text-an-action-is-direct-with-digital-text-actions-are-interactive">2. With paper text an action is direct; with digital text actions are interactive.</h4>

<p>When engaging with paper text any action is direct. That is, actions such as writing, underlining, erasing, cutting out, pasting in, folding, sorting and resorting, are in a direct relationship between the action, the operations involved in that action, and the perception of that action. In the digital realm, a command — which can be a key stroke, a tap on a touchscreen, a verbal utterance, and so on — can equate a near infinite set of (opaque) operations.</p>

<p>Given these distinguishing properties, digital text invites tinkering with its parts in ways that are infeasible with text on the paper page. Exploring the potential of these properties of digital text, based on the premise that all texts are interconnected, is the aim of this project.</p>

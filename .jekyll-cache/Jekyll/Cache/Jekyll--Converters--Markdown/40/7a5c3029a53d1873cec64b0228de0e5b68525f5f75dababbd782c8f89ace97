I"∞T<p>‚ú± It‚Äôs a draft. I‚Äôm still working on automating citations so for now there are horrendous footnotes.</p>

<p>A document is a container of content items, which can vary in modality (text, images). Content items are what Rosenberg calls ‚Äúinformation chunks‚Äù<sup id="fnref:Rosenberg2015" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Rosenberg2015" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>; DeRose calls ‚Äúcontent objects‚Äù<sup id="fnref:DeRose1990" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:DeRose1990" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>; Nelson calls ‚Äúparagraph-like content items.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:Nelson1999" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Nelson1999" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> In traditional terms, a paragraph is a content item; a quote within a paragraph is also a content item; a list and a list item are content items. In other words, content items vary not only in modality but in type.</p>

<p>The concept of interconnection, on which this project is based, denotes the various connections among the content items of documents. As explained by Nelson,<sup id="fnref:Nelson1999:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Nelson1999" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> connections can be internal or external to a document, stated implicitly or explicitly. For example, phrases such as <em>the example given above</em> or <em>as demonstrated in the image below</em> or <em>as stated previously</em> create implicit internal connections. Explicit internal connections are content items that by convention take the form of a footnote or marginal annotations, the content of which can be an elaboration of a term used, an example of something, or a tangent or comment on something. Explicit external connections are inclusions of one document segment into another (what Nelson coined transclusions<sup id="fnref:Nelson" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Nelson" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>) or some other direct connection by way of reference.</p>

<p>There are various terms used to express the idea of interconnection. As Christine Borgman writes, ‚Äú[t]he body of relationships among documents is sometimes known as <em>hypertextuality</em>, and in semiotics and literary studies, it is called <em>intertextuality</em>, which are abstract connections, ‚Äúas in the influence of one text on the meaning of another.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:Borgman2015" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Borgman2015" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> Ted Nelson calls it <em>intertwingularity</em> which ‚Äúexpresses a philosophical position about cross-connection,‚Äù namely that ‚Äúall subjects and issues are intertwined and intermingled.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:Nelson2015" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Nelson2015" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> Lastly, by example, a data model based on interconnection is one that allows a many-to-many relationship among entities. Entities with many many-to-many relationships form clusters, and clusters can also form many-to-many relationships to other clusters. Further, the connections can be based on (or describe, or establish, or map) various relationship types.</p>

<p>So interconnection here means <em>connected on multiple levels</em> and is used to describe the various relationships among the contents of documents, some of which go beyond the boundary of documents. Mapping these connections creates complex hyper-structures, and how exactly these are mapped and visualized is shaped by the medium of the document. In what follows, analog and digital systems designed for mapping, visualizing, and accessing content based on interconnection are examined.</p>

<h3 id="analog-and-digital-systems-based-on-interconnection">Analog and Digital Systems Based on Interconnection</h3>

<p>An early analog system developed for mapping and visualizing interconnection is the ‚Äúcompilation of Jewish Oral Law with its rabbinical commentaries‚Äù organized according to the Talmud page. Representing centuries of religious discussion, the Talmud:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>consists of the core texts, commentaries by various authors [‚Ä¶] navigational aids (such as page number, tractate name, chapter number, chapter name) and glosses. Most of these glosses are emendations to the text, while others contain useful (or cryptic) cross-references. (Neum√ºller transcluded from Ridi<sup id="fnref:Ridi2018" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Ridi2018" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The image below demonstrates how the Talmud Page is organized.</p>

<p>Other analog systems include the Encyclop√©die by Denis Diderot and Jean d‚ÄôAlembert; Paul Otlet‚Äôs principles, methods, and model of a global network of documentation; the hypothetical machine the Memex by Vannevar Bush; and Niklas Luhmann‚Äôs notecard system based on the Zettelkasten Method. The most prominent example of a digital system is the project Xanadu by Ted Nelson. These all share the conceptualization of documents as nodes that are linked through some mechanism and according to a system. In other words, these are examples of hyper-structures. In consideration of the scope of this entry, three of the examples given above are examined in more depth:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Encyclop√©die by Denis Diderot and Jean d‚ÄôAlembert</li>
  <li>The work of Paul Otlet</li>
  <li>Xanadu by Ted Nelson</li>
</ol>

<p>Encyclop√©die is a system of intraconnections (i.e., a closed system of internal connections; intranet). Otlet‚Äôs principles, concepts, and models are based on interconnections and emergent structure (i.e., open system of connections). Xanadu by Ted Nelson is also a system of interconnections and emergent structure, but with consideration of the potential of the computer as a universal machine.</p>

<!-- As van der Weel explains, that the computer is universal machine means:
> ...that it is an instrument capable of performing on text not only all medial functions such as creating, editing, storing, publishing, distributing and consuming it, but also operations of various kinds. [F]unctioning electronically and digitally, [it can] run every conceivable type of application.[^Weel2012] -->

<h4 id="1-encyclop√©die-by-diderot-and-dalembert">1 Encyclop√©die by Diderot and d‚ÄôAlembert</h4>

<p>Various information technologies for mapping interconnection (non-)hierarchically were produced in the eighteenth century, ranging from atlases, encyclopedias, dictionaries, and suchlike. A prominent example is the Encyclop√©die by Diderot and d‚ÄôAlembert, which was, as Rosenberg<sup id="fnref:Rosenberg2015:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Rosenberg2015" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> argues, an innovative system for its time. In its entirety, the Encyclop√©die is a system of intraconnections ‚Äî which is to say, a closed system of cross-references ‚Äî comprising 28 volumes of 72000 entries by more than 2000 writers. Though the design incorporates ways for external reference, the Encyclop√©die was conceived and meant to be used as an independent system.</p>

<p>The alphabetical structure is embedded as running headers throughout the encyclopedia (as seen in the image below), allowing access to content by headword.</p>

<p><em>Transcluded from <a href="https://archive.org/details/encyclopdieoud01alem/page/312/mode/2up">Internet Archive</a></em></p>

<p>Other examples include annotated diagrams depicting the contents and functioning as a visual index. A tree diagram from the first volume is seen in the image below.</p>

<p>Transcluded from <a href="https://archive.org/details/encyclopdieoud01alem/page/n69/mode/1up">Internet Archive</a></p>

<p>The textual and diagrammatic ways of mapping structures are hierarchical, as was the convention at the time. However, as Rosenberg explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Older encyclopedias were generally organized hierarchically and by subject. Theirs was designed to be navigated by keyword, to allow readers to enter and exit at any useful point. Additionally, their encyclopedia was hypertexted. Articles were linked in a web through a system of renvois or cross-references. The Encyclop√©die also offered a hierarchical subject map, echoing the structure of older works, but, in the work of Diderot and d‚ÄôAlembert, the tree of knowledge was presented as only one of several heuristics.<sup id="fnref:Rosenberg2015:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Rosenberg2015" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, as the computer-generated diagram (seen in the image below) elucidate, an underlying structure ‚Äúimplicit in the system of cross-references of the Encyclop√©die‚Äù<sup id="fnref:Rosenberg2015:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Rosenberg2015" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> is a network structure in which there are many-to-many relationships among subjects.</p>

<p><img src="assets/diderot_encyclopedie_map_crop.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Diagram by Olsen and Blanchard (transcluded from Rosenberg<sup id="fnref:Rosenberg2015:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Rosenberg2015" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></em></p>

<p>There are two significant points the diagram elucidates. First, conceiving knowledge as fundamentally hierarchical is not ‚Äúparadigmatic of Enlightenment epistemology,‚Äù and second, nor is it intrinsic to print. As Rosenberg argues, though the</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>network diagram would not have been familiar to the generation of the Encyclopedists, the concepts behind it were. They too were thinking about intellectual phenomena in terms of underlying structures and aggregate relationships.<sup id="fnref:Rosenberg2015:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Rosenberg2015" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In sum:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Significant to the design of the Encyclop√©die:
    <ul>
      <li>A system of intraconnections typographically embedded as links.</li>
      <li>Multiple (non-)hierarchical structures are mapped, both textual and diagrammatic in form, offering multiple ways of accessing content.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2-the-work-of-paul-otlet">2 The Work of Paul Otlet</h4>

<p>The work of Paul Otlet ‚Äî regarded as a pioneer of the field once called documentation that branched into what is now called information science<sup id="fnref:DeuffPerret2019" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:DeuffPerret2019" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> ‚Äî range from devising the model called Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records in which entities are linked on multiple levels in the form of a network[Borgman], developing new approaches to organizing and accessing information, establishing theoretical principles of information, to drawing illustrations serving as metaphors of a global network of documents once media other than the book would take precedence[sources].</p>

<p>Similar to the Encyclop√©die ‚Äî a project regarded as in response to the eighteenth-century information overload<sup id="fnref:Rosenberg2015:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Rosenberg2015" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> ‚Äî Otlet‚Äôs work was in response to the problem of ‚Äúthe enormous growth in the number of publications, specialist congresses, and international exhibitions that began to occur at the end of the nineteenth century‚Äù [Manfroid].</p>

<p>As Rayward formulates it, the problem that Otlet analyzed and explored solutions to was ‚Äúhow most effectively to create, maintain, and change institutional arrangements for collecting, storing, preserving, organizing, retrieving, and disseminating all of the recorded information that is-or will be-needed within society‚Äù [Rayward]. With that complex problem at hand, Otlet envisioned new approaches to storing, organizing, and disseminating information accommodating expansive growth and extensive reuse. Some of the most significant aspects of his work are delineated below.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Conceptualization of text as modular.</li>
  <li>Re-conceptualizing the Book as:
    <ul>
      <li>A global system of linked content items.
        <ul>
          <li>Based on interconnection and emergent structure.</li>
          <li>Necessity of multidimensional linking of content items.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Otlet conceptualized text as modular ‚Äî made up of parts connected to other parts (internal and external to a document). An appropriate system, according to Otlet, must therefore allow and facilitate establishing links between these <em>parts</em> (content items). In designing such a system, Otlet explored the re-conceptualization of the Book as a global system of documents. As told by van den Heuvel and Rayward:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a 1911 lecture on the future of the book and of bibliography, Otlet came back to the idea he had first expressed in 1892 and in subsequent publications: ‚ÄòThe arbitrary division into lines and pages of the book in its present format, does not at all correspond all with the presentation of ideas‚Äô (p. 291). He envisioned the emergence of a future format of the book in which ‚Äòeach intellectual element, in corresponding to a physical element, will create a structure such that any combination of ideas, notions, and facts will be possible.‚Äô He suggested that this process can operate in so mechanical a fashion that in the future, the book will truly become a machine to think with (‚Äúmachine √† penser;‚Äù Otlet, 1911, p. 291).<sup id="fnref:HeuvelRayward2011" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:HeuvelRayward2011" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the illustration below suggests, for Otlet, the development of such a system begins with <em>ripping</em> content items (representing ideas, notions, facts) from books and collecting each on separate paper cards.</p>

<p><img src="assets/the-book-in-connection-with-the-library-the-bibliographic-repertory-and-encyclopedia.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Global Network of Universal Documentation (transcluded from Heuvel and Rayward<sup id="fnref:HeuvelRayward2011:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:HeuvelRayward2011" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>)</em></p>

<!-- Based on interconnection and emergent structure.
Necessity of multidimensional linking of content items. -->

<p>The system must, therefore, also be designed to accommodate expansive growth and extensive reuse. For Otlet, this meant the capacity to store content items by links and metadata and to access the content items based on those links and metadata. In the image below, Otlet explored a paper card-based system that could establish multidimensional links between content items.</p>

<p><img src="assets/otlet_card_experiments.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Multidimensional card system (transcluded from <a href="https://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/images/e/e2/Heuvel_Rayward_Facing_Interfaces.pdf">Heuvel and Rayward</a>)</em></p>

<p>As Otlet writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To increase the number of sides, one might well abandon the rectangular form of the card and adopt a polygonal form, an octagon for example. For sorting and systematically selecting the ideas that have been classified hierarchically, the cards are suspended from their centre. The Book as a structure of cards thus takes a quasi-circular form and can rotate. [I]ts structure [‚Ä¶] constitutes a Book‚Äîfor it is still a book‚Äîthat has abandoned the traditional form of linear text arranged according to a unique plan. It has been transformed in some way into a body with several dimensions, as many dimensions as headings such that different searches using the same graphic elements on the cards are possible. (Otlet transcluded from Heuvel and Rayward]<sup id="fnref:HeuvelRayward2011:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:HeuvelRayward2011" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As van den Heuvel and Rayward point out, though the material manifestation of such a paper card system is ‚Äúimpractical for many reasons,‚Äù<sup id="fnref:HeuvelRayward2011:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:HeuvelRayward2011" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> what Otlet is describing is an open system for mapping and accessing content based on the interconnection of subjects. Beyond these experiments with paper cards, Otlet envisioned new approaches to accessing content and new visual representations. For example, in the image below, ‚ÄúOtlet uses the architectural metaphor of the factory to visualize this process.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:Heuvel2017" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Heuvel2017" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="assets/otlet_mundaneum.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Laboratorium Mundaneum (transcluded from <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Laboratorium_Mundaneum.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a>)</em></p>

<p>Though Otlet was inhibited by the constraints of working with paper-based technologies (e.g., books, paper cards, shelves, cabinets, and desks), he envisioned new ways of organizing and accessing information beyond what van der Weel calls <em>the order of the book</em>.</p>

<p>In sum, significant to the work of Otlet:
	- Conceptualization of text as modular; made up of content items.
	- Developed a system based on interconnections; networked information organization based on emergent structure and new ways of linking those content items.
	- Explored ways of storing and accessing content items through experiments with cards and metaphorical visualizations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Redesign of links to distinguish:
    <ul>
      <li>Link direction.</li>
      <li>Link endpoint (by improving the design of the brackets).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Added a legend (a list of the icons and symbols).</li>
  <li>Color coding:
    <ul>
      <li>Title underline is replaced by border color.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="visual-distinction-of-links-link-type-link-direction-link-endpoint">Visual Distinction of Links: Link Type, Link Direction, Link Endpoint</h2>

<p><strong>Link types</strong>: <em>Transclusion</em>, <em>seqlink</em>, and <em>taglink</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Link direction</strong>: To or from a document and another.</p>

<p><strong>Link endpoints</strong>: Distinguishing between a link that points to an entire document and a link that points to a particular part of a document.</p>

<p>Examples of different link types, directions, and endpoints are seen in the image below.</p>

<p>Links are visualized as a single element separate from the label.</p>

<p>The image below shows what it would look like if multiple labels were attached to a taglink.</p>

<h2 id="improvements-due">Improvements Due</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Color-coding needs improvement.
    <ul>
      <li>As noted in the <a href="14">previous entry</a>, there are only so many distinct colors. A two-color system can be applied. One active color for the open document and an inactive color for the aliases.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="16">next entry</a> explores the implementation of these alterations in the concept design.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The continuation of representing documents as nodes in Lateral Mode is potentially distracting and not particularly useful. There could be a benefit from distinguishing how documents are represented in each mode.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Linked documents are no longer represented as nodes in Vertical and Lateral Mode, rather as icons.</li>

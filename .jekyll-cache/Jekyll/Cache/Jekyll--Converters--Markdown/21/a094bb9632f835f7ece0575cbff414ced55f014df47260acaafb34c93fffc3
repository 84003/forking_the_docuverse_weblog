I".<p>The first section of this entry introduces the concept of interconnection, the various terms used to express the idea of interconnection across fields, and the underlying philosophical position. The second section examines analog and digital systems developed throughout history, comprising concepts for representing interconnection. Those concepts are juxtaposed to how they have been implemented in commonly known systems, such as how hypertext is implemented on the Web. The biases and conventions inherited from paper documents are also discussed, including the (dis)advantages of transferring these (or how these have been transferred) to the digital realm. The aim is to gather insight into which features of the systems can be utilized in creating a construct based on accommodating interconnection.</p>

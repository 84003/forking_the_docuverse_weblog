I"<p>The intent here is to clarify which concepts are to become components of the construct and how those components interact.</p>

<p>Questions are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What can documents contain?</li>
  <li>How are links created, and which link types?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-document-and-its-content-items">A Document and Its Content Items</h2>

<p>A document is defined in general terms as a container of content items to which links can be attached on the level of the document and the level of the content item. The representation of a document can change in each view mode.</p>

<p>A document can contain a single or multiple content items which may vary in modality (e.g., text, image, sound). Content items may vary in modality and may be further distinguished by type. In conventional terms, a paragraph, for example, is a content item; a quote within a paragraph is also a content item; a list and a list item are content items.</p>

<h2 id="link-types">Link Types</h2>

<p>Two main link types can be established between content items: transclusions and those that are not transclusions, called <em>tag links</em> and can include a descriptive label or remain empty.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Transclusion</strong> —-</li>
  <li><strong>Tag link</strong> –#–</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-transclusion--">1. Transclusion —-</h3>

<p>A transclusion is created when a content item from one document is included in another document.<sup id="fnref:excerpts" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:excerpts" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Transclusions are reused content items with visible links and thus offer a way to retrieve “the origins and context of quotations, excerpts and anthologized materials, and content transiting between versions” (Nelson Xanalogical). The image below shows the concept of transclusion on a technical level.</p>

<h3 id="2-tag-link-">2. Tag link –#–</h3>

<p><em>Tag links</em> are created by connecting two separate content items and can include a descriptive label (#Label) or remain empty (#). Utilizing the common usage of hashtag<sup id="fnref:hashtag" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hashtag" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> as a means to categorize content, <em>tag links</em> enable people to organize and filter links based on their developed taxonomy. Examples of <em>tag links</em> are given below.</p>

<h2 id="endnotes">Endnotes</h2>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:excerpts" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Conventionally, these are called excerpts and typographically classified as block quotes or inline quotes, and the link between the <em>copied</em> and the <em>pasted</em> is usually embedded as a citation. <a href="#fnref:excerpts" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:hashtag" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>The word hashtag refers to the symbol # (as popularized by Twitter) and combines the word hash from the hash mark and the word tag as it is used to label something belonging to a specific category. <a href="#fnref:hashtag" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

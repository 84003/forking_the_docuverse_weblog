I"Ï<p>Documents can be seen as containers of content items (representing ideas, beliefs, facts, and so on). By creating different types of connections among content items, an interconnective structure can be formed. This research project explores new approaches to representational concepts for mapping and accessing the interconnective structure of documents to enable new ways of traversing documents through interaction. These concepts have been derived through examining prominent document systems considered influential in the evolution of information technologies. The method is based on an iterative process of content creation, concept design, and creating interactive prototypes of a digital document system.</p>
